<p>The main advantage of Databricks Community Edition (CE) is its convenience: it offers an MLflow tracking server without requiring
<a href="https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/getting-started/logging-first-model/step1-tracking-server.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">local infrastructure setup</a>. You can easily access this server through the
<a href="https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.login" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mlflow.login()</a> function after creating your CE account, streamlining the process for MLflow experiment tracking.</p>
<p>To authenticate with Databricks CE, use the <a href="https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.login" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mlflow.login()</a> function. This will prompt you for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Databricks Host</strong>: <code>https://community.cloud.databricks.com/</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Username</strong>: Your Databricks CE email address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Password</strong>: Your Databricks CE password.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looking to learn more about the autologging functionality included in MLflow? Look no further than this primer on the basics of using this powerful and time-saving feature!</p>
<p>Robust logging practices are central to the iterative development and improvement of machine learning models. Carefully tracking metrics, parameters, and artifacts can be challenging when working with complex machine learning libraries or when experimenting with multiple different frameworks with varying APIs and selections of different objects and values to track.</p>
<p>MLflow’s <strong>automatic logging functionality</strong> offers a simple solution that is compatible with many widely-used machine learning libraries, such as <a href="https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pytorch.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PyTorch</a>, <a href="https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.sklearn.html#mlflow.sklearn.autolog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scikit-learn</a>, and <a href="https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.xgboost.html#mlflow.xgboost.autolog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XGBoost</a>. Using <code>mlflow.autolog()</code> instructs MLflow to capture essential data without requiring the user to specify what to capture manually. It is an accessible and powerful entrypoint for MLflow’s logging capabilities.</p>
<p>To enable automatic logging, simply add the following line to your machine learning scripts/notebooks, before initiating activities like model training or evaluation that may include information or artifacts you would like to log:</p>

<p>When a data science workflow includes <code>mlflow.autolog()</code>, MLflow will automatically log:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Metrics</strong>: standard training and evaluation measures such as accuracy and F1 score;</li>
<li><strong>Parameters</strong>: hyperparameters, such as learning rate and number of estimators; and</li>
<li><strong>Artifacts</strong>: important files, such as trained models.</li>
</ul>
<p>MLflow’s automatic logging captures details tailored to the specific activities of the library being used: different libraries will result in different logged objects and data. In addition, MLflow logs key metadata such as software versions, a git commit hash, and the file name from which the run was initiated. By documenting the system's state during model training, MLflow aims to facilitate environment reproducibility and provide audit lineage, minimizing the possibility of inference issues that could arise from package regressions or deprecations in newer library versions.</p>
<p>The specifics of what is captured through automatic logging depend on the libraries used. Additionally, MLflow captures contextual metadata such as software versions, git commit hash, and the name of the file from which the run was launched. By logging as much detail as possible about the state of the system that trained the model, MLflow can offer environment reproducibility and audit lineage, minimizing the possibility of inference issues resulting from, for example, package regressions or deprecations.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="basic-usage-of-mlflowautolog">Basic Usage of <code>mlflow.autolog</code><a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/mlflow-website/blog/2023/11/30/mlflow-autolog#basic-usage-of-mlflowautolog" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to basic-usage-of-mlflowautolog" title="Direct link to basic-usage-of-mlflowautolog">​</a></h2>
<p>You can access auto logging functionality in two different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Via the <code>mlflow.autolog()</code> function, which enables and configures automatic logging across all supported libraries. This provides a broad, one-size-fits-all approach when working with multiple libraries and is ideal for prototyping and exploratory analysis of a machine learning pipeline.</li>
<li>Via the library-specific autolog functions, such as <code>mlflow.sklearn.autolog()</code>, which enable finer-grained logging configuration for individual libraries. For example, <code>mlflow.pytorch.autolog()</code> includes the <code>log_every_n_epoch</code> and <code>log_every_n_step</code> arguments for specifying how often to log metrics.</li>
</ol>
<p>Regardless of which of these two approaches you use, you do not need to manually initialize an MLflow run with <a href="https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.start_run" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start_run()</a> in order to have a run created and for your model, parameters, and metrics to be captured in MLflow.</p>

<p>The automatic logging functions take many arguments that give the user greater control over logging behavior. For example, <code>mlflow.autolog()</code> includes <code>log_models</code> and <code>log_datasets</code> arguments (both <code>True</code> by default) that specify whether models and dataset information should be saved to the MLflow run, enabling you to specify what is actually logged. To disable automatic logging of datasets while continuing to log all the usual elements, simply disable the autologging of datasets feature by setting <code>mlflow.autolog(log_datasets=False)</code> before fitting a model. You can also adjust the behavior of library-specific autolog functions: for example, the <code>mlflow.sklearn.autolog()</code> function includes a <code>max_tuning_runs</code> argument that specifies how many nested runs to capture when performing hyperparameter searches.</p>
<p><code>mlflow.autolog()</code> can be used in combination with the library-specific autolog functions to control the logging behavior for specific libraries. The library-specific autolog call will always supersede <code>mlflow.autolog()</code>, regardless of the order in which they are called. For example, combining <code>mlflow.autolog()</code> with <code>mlflow.sklearn.autolog(disable=True)</code> will result in automatic logging for all supported libraries except for <code>scikit-learn</code>.</p>
<p>It is important to consult the documentation for the specific framework(s) you are using in order to understand what is logged automatically and what configuration options are available. See the <a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/mlflow-website/blog/2023/11/30/mlflow-autolog#further-reading">further reading section below</a> for links.</p>

<p>MLflow's autologging capabilities and library-specific automatic logging functions provide a straightforward starting point for MLflow tracking with little or no required configuration. They log key metrics, parameters, and artifacts from many popular machine learning libraries, allowing users to track their machine learning workflows without writing custom tracking code.</p>
<p>They are not, however, the right solution for all use cases. If you only need to track a handful of specific metrics, enabling automatic logging may be inefficient, resulting in much more generated data and stored artifacts than needed. Furthermore, automatic logging is not available for every possible framework and custom values one might want to track. In such cases, it might be necessary to <a href="https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking/tracking-api.html#logging-functions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">manually specify what to track</a>.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="overhauling-the-mlflow-docs">Overhauling the MLflow Docs<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/mlflow-website/blog/2023/10/31/mlflow-docs-overhaul#overhauling-the-mlflow-docs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Overhauling the MLflow Docs" title="Direct link to Overhauling the MLflow Docs">​</a></h2>
<p>We're thrilled to announce a comprehensive overhaul of the MLflow Docs. This initiative is not just about refreshing the look and feel but about reimagining how our users interact with our content. Our primary goal is to enhance clarity, improve navigation, and provide more in-depth resources for our community.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-renewed-focus-on-user-experience">A Renewed Focus on User Experience<a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/mlflow-website/blog/2023/10/31/mlflow-docs-overhaul#a-renewed-focus-on-user-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Renewed Focus on User Experience" title="Direct link to A Renewed Focus on User Experience">​</a></h2>
<p>The MLflow documentation has always been an essential resource for our users. Over time, we've received invaluable feedback, and we've listened. The modernization effort is a direct response to the needs and preferences of our community.</p>
<p>Along with working on covering new cutting-edge features as part of this documentation overhaul, we're working on addressing the complexity of getting started. As the first part of a series of tutorials and guides focusing on the initial learning phase, we've created a new <a href="https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/getting-started/logging-first-model/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting started guide</a>, the first of many in a new series we're working on in an effort to teach the fundamentals of using MLflow. We feel that more in-depth instructional tutorials for learning the concepts and tools of MLflow will help to enhance the user experience for not only new users, but experienced users who need a refresher of how to do certain tasks.</p>
<p>There are more of these coming in the future!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="easier-navigation"><strong>Easier Navigation</strong><a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/mlflow-website/blog/2023/10/31/mlflow-docs-overhaul#easier-navigation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to easier-navigation" title="Direct link to easier-navigation">​</a></h3>
<p>Our first order of business is to declutter and reorganize. This is going to be a process, though. With some of the monolithic pages (<a href="https://www.mlflow.org/docs/2.7.1/models.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mlflow Models</a>), this will be more of a marathon than a sprint.</p>
<p>We've introduced a <a href="https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new main navigation page</a> in an effort to help steer you to the content that you're looking for based on end-use domain, rather than component of MLflow. We're hoping that this helps to bring new feature content and useful examples to your awareness, limiting the amount of exploratory discovery needed to understand how to use these new features.</p>
<p>Another priority for us was to make major new features easier to discover. While the <a href="https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">release notes</a> are useful, particularly for Engineers who are maintaining integrations with, or are managing a deployment of, MLflow, they're not particularly user-friendly for an end-user of MLflow. We felt that a curated list of major new features would help to distill the information in our release notes, so we built the <a href="https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/new-features/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new features</a> page. We sincerely hope it helps to reduce the amount of effort needed to know what new major features have been released.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="interactive-learning-with-notebooks"><strong>Interactive Learning with Notebooks</strong><a href="https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com/mlflow-website/blog/2023/10/31/mlflow-docs-overhaul#interactive-learning-with-notebooks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to interactive-learning-with-notebooks" title="Direct link to interactive-learning-with-notebooks">​</a></h3>
<p>In today's fast-paced tech world, interactive learning is becoming the norm. Recognizing this trend, we're embedding viewable notebooks directly within the docs. But we're not stopping there.

<p>While our previous documentation provided a solid foundation, we felt there was room for more detailed explorations. We're introducing comprehensive <a href="https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/traditional-ml/creating-custom-pyfunc/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutorials</a> and <a href="https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/llm-evaluate/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guides</a> that delve deep into MLflow's features, showing how to solve actual problems. These first new tutorials and guides are just the start. We're going to be spending a lot of time and effort on making much more of MLflow documented in this way, helping to dramatically reduce the amount of time you have to spend figuring out how to leverage features in MLflow.</p>
