The call was made, and the community answered in droves.

We're thrilled to present our MLflow Ambassadors, a select group distinguished by their commitment to mentoring, teaching, and most importantly, building AI solutions.

These ambassadors will be visible at various industry meetups and speaking engagements, as well as through their insightful contributions right here
in our [MLflow Blog](blog). They'll be sharing their invaluable expertise, experiences, and tips on leveraging MLflow for practical MLOps applications, as well as
in-depth tutorials on how to leverage some of the more advanced features of MLflow. Representing a wide array of backgrounds and industries, each ambassador
brings a unique perspective fueled by a shared enthusiasm for innovation and education in the field.

Over the next few months, you'll be seeing a lot more from them both on our platform, at local meetups, and as speakers on behalf of the MLflow project.
