## 3.2.0rc0 (2025-07-29)

MLflow 3.2.0rc0 includes several major features and improvements

### Major New Features

- üß≠ **Tracing TypeScript SDK**: MLflow Tracing now supports the [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/master/libs/typescript), allowing developers to trace GenAI applications in TypeScript environments. ([#16871](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/16871), [@B-Step62](https://github.com/B-Step62))
- üîó **Semantic Kernel Tracing**: MLflow now provides [automatic tracing support for Semantic Kernel](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/integrations/listing/semantic_kernel/), simplifying trace capture for SK-based workflows.

### üìä Usage Tracking (New in 3.2.0)

- Starting with version 3.2.0, MLflow will begin collecting anonymized usage data about how core features of the platform are used. This data contains **no sensitive or personally identifiable information**, and users can opt out of data collection at any time. Check [MLflow documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/community/usage-tracking) for more details. If you have questions or feedback, please visit this [Github Issue](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/16944).
