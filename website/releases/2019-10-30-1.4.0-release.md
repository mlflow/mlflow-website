We are happy to announce the availability of [MLflow 1.4.0](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v1.4.0)!

In addition to bug and documentation fixes, MLflow 1.4.0 includes the following major features and improvements:

- Model Registry (Beta). MLflow 1.4.0 adds an experimental model registry feature, where you can manage, version, and keep lineage of your production models.
- TensorFlow updates
  - MLflow Keras model saving, loading, and logging has been updated to be compatible with TensorFlow 2.0.
  - Autologging for `tf.estimator` and `tf.keras` models has been updated to be compatible with TensorFlow 2.0. The same functionalities of autologging in TensorFlow 1.x are available in TensorFlow 2.0, namely when fitting `tf.keras` models and when exporting saved `tf.estimator` models.
  - Examples and READMEs for both TensorFlow 1.X and TensorFlow 2.0 have been added to `mlflow/examples/tensorflow`.
