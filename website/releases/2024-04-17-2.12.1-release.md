MLflow 2.12.1 includes several major features and improvements

With this release, we're pleased to introduce several major new features that are focused on enhanced GenAI support, Deep Learning workflows involving images, expanded table logging functionality, and general usability enhancements within the UI and external integrations.

## Major New Features

### PromptFlow

Introducing the new PromptFlow flavor, designed to enrich the GenAI landscape within MLflow. This feature simplifies the creation and management of dynamic prompts, enhancing user interaction with AI models and streamlining prompt engineering processes. ([#11311](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11311), [#11385](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11385) [@brynn-code](https://github.com/brynn-code))

### Enhanced Metadata Sharing for Unity Catalog

MLflow now supports the ability to share metadata (and not model weights) within Databricks Unity Catalog. When logging a model, this functionality enables the automatic duplication of metadata into a dedicated subdirectory, distinct from the modelâ€™s actual storage location, allowing for different sharing permissions and access control limits. ([#11357](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11357), [#11720](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11720) [@WeichenXu123](https://github.com/WeichenXu123))

### Code Paths Unification and Standardization

We have unified and standardized the `code_paths` parameter across all MLflow flavors to ensure a cohesive and streamlined user experience. This change promotes consistency and reduces complexity in the model deployment lifecycle. ([#11688](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11688), [@BenWilson2](https://github.com/BenWilson2))

### ChatOpenAI and AzureChatOpenAI Support

Support for the ChatOpenAI and AzureChatOpenAI interfaces has been integrated into the LangChain flavor, facilitating seamless deployment of conversational AI models. This development opens new doors for building sophisticated and responsive chat applications leveraging cutting-edge language models. ([#11644](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11644), [@B-Step62](https://github.com/B-Step62))

### Custom Models in Sentence-Transformers

The sentence-transformers flavor now supports custom models, allowing for a greater flexibility in deploying tailored NLP solutions. ([#11635](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11635), [@B-Step62](https://github.com/B-Step62))

### Native MLflow Image support in the `log_image` API

Added support for optimized image logging, including step-based iterative logging for images generated as part of a training run. This feature enables the ability to track your image generation, classification, segmentation, enhancement and object detection deep learning models effortlessly. ([#11243](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11243), [#11404](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11404), [@jessechancy](https://github.com/jessechancy))

### Image Support for Log Table

With the addition of image support in `log_table`, MLflow enhances its capabilities in handling rich media. This functionality allows for direct logging and visualization of images within the platform, improving the interpretability and analysis of visual data. ([#11535](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11535), [@jessechancy](https://github.com/jessechancy))

### Streaming Support for LangChain

The newly introduced `predict_stream` API for LangChain models supports streaming outputs, enabling real-time output for chain invocation via pyfunc. This feature is pivotal for applications requiring continuous data processing and instant feedback. ([#11490](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11490), [#11580](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11580) [@WeichenXu123](https://github.com/WeichenXu123))

## Security Fixes

### LFI Security Patch

Addressed a critical Local File Read/Path Traversal vulnerability within the Model Registry, ensuring robust protection against unauthorized access and securing user data integrity. ([#11376](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11376), [@WeichenXu123](https://github.com/WeichenXu123))
