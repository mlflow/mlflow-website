We are happy to announce the availability of [MLflow 0.4.0](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v0.4.0)!

MLflow Release 0.4.0 is ready, released 2018-08-01. The release is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mlflow/) and docs are [updated](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html). Here are the release notes (also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v0.4.0)):

Breaking changes:

- [Projects] Removed the use_temp_cwd argument to mlflow.projects.run()
  (--new-dir flag in the mlflow run CLI). Runs of local projects now use the local project directory as their working directory. Git projects are still fetched into temporary directories ([#215](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/215), [@smurching](https://github.com/smurching))
- [Tracking] GCS artifact storage is now a pluggable dependency (no longer installed by default). To enable GCS support, install google-cloud-storage on both the client and tracking server via pip ([#202](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/202), [@smurching](https://github.com/smurching)).
- [Tracking] Clients running MLflow 0.4.0 and above require a server running MLflow 0.4.0
  or above, due to a fix that ensures clients no longer double-serialize JSON into strings when sending data to the server ([#200](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/200), [@aarondav](https://github.com/aarondav)). However, the MLflow 0.4.0 server remains backwards-compatible with older clients ([#216](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/216), [@aarondav](https://github.com/aarondav))

Features:

- [Examples] Add a more advanced tracking example: using MLflow with PyTorch and TensorBoard ([#203](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/203))
- [Models] H2O model support ([#170](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/170), [@ToonKBC](https://github.com/ToonKBC))
- [Projects] Support for running projects in subdirectories of Git repos ([#153](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/153), [@juntai-zheng](https://github.com/juntai-zheng))
- [SageMaker] Support for specifying a compute specification when deploying to SageMaker ([#185](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/185), [@dbczumar](https://github.com/dbczumar))
- [Server] Added --static-prefix option to serve UI from a specified prefix to MLflow UI and server ([#116](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/116), [@andrewmchen](https://github.com/andrewmchen))
- [Tracking] Azure blob storage support for artifacts ([#206](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/206), [@mateiz](https://github.com/mateiz))
- [Tracking] Add support for Databricks-backed RestStore ([#200](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/200), [@aarondav](https://github.com/aarondav))
- [UI] Enable productionizing frontend by adding CSRF support ([#199](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/199), [@aarondav](https://github.com/aarondav))
- [UI] Update metric and parameter filters to let users control column order ([#186](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/186), [@mateiz](https://github.com/mateiz))

Bug fixes:

- Fixed incompatible file structure returned by GCSArtifactRepository ([#173](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/173), [@jakeret](https://github.com/jakeret))
- Fixed metric values going out of order on x axis ([#204](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/204), [@mateiz](https://github.com/mateiz))
- Fixed occasional hanging behavior when using the projects.run API ([#193](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/193), [@smurching](https://github.com/smurching))
- Miscellaneous bug and documentation fixes from [@aarondav](https://github.com/aarondav), [@andrewmchen](https://github.com/andrewmchen), [@arinto](https://github.com/arinto), [@jakeret](https://github.com/jakeret), [@mateiz](https://github.com/mateiz), [@smurching](https://github.com/smurching), [@stbof](https://github.com/stbof)
