## 2.18.0 (2024-11-12)

The 2.18.0 release includes a number of signficant features, enhancements, and bug fixes.

### Python Version Update

Python 3.8 is now at an end-of-life point. With official support being dropped for this legacy version, **MLflow now requires Python 3.9**
as a minimum supported version.

> Note: If you are currently using MLflow's `ChatModel` interface for authoring custom GenAI applications, please ensure that you
> have read the future breaking changes section below.

### Breaking Changes to Experimental Features

- **ChatModel Interface Changes** - As part of a broader unification effort within MLflow and services that rely on or deeply integrate
  with MLflow's GenAI features, we are working on a phased approach to making a consistent and standard interface for custom GenAI
  application development and usage. In the first phase (planned for release in the next few releases of MLflow), we are marking
  several interfaces as deprecated, as they will be changing. These changes will be:

  - **Renaming of ChatModel Interfaces**
    - `ChatRequest` is being renamed to `ChatCompletionRequest` to provide disambiguation for future planned request interface
      types. `ChatRequest` is too generic for planned future work.
    - `ChatResponse` is being renamed to `ChatCompletionResponse` for the same reason as the input interface.
    - `predict_stream` is being updated to provide actual streaming capabilities for custom GenAI applications. Currently, the return type of
      `predict_stream` is a generator containing the synchronous output from a call to `predict`. In a future release, this will be changing to
      return a generator of Chunks. While your existing call structure for the `predict_stream` API won't change, the returned data payload will
      change significantly and allow for a true streaming return as asynchronous streaming values are returned. The updated return type will be
      a generator of `ChatCompletionChunks`, similar to the existing implementation for `LangChain`.
    - The mutable components of `ChatRequest` and `ChatResponse`, both currently set as `metadata` fields, will be renamed to the more specific
      respective `custom_inputs` and `custom_outputs`. These field names will be made consistent with future GenAI interfaces as well.
  - **Deprecation of Rag Signatures**
    - In an effort to reduce the complexity with interfaces to different systems, we will be marking the dataclasses defined within
      `mlflow.models.rag_signatures` as deprecated in a future release and merging these with the unified signature definitions and data
      structures within `ChatCompletionRequest`, `ChatCompletionResponse` and `ChatCompletionChunks`.

### Major New Features

- **Fluent API Thread / Process Safety** - MLflow's fluent APIs for tracking and the model registry have been overhauled to add support for both thread and multi-process safety.
  You are now no longer forced to use the Client APIs for managing experiments, runs, and logging from within multiprocessing and threaded applications. ([#13456](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13456), [#13419](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13419), [@WeichenXu123](https://github.com/WeichenXu123))

- **Broad Support for LLM-as-a-judge endpoints** - Prior to this release, MLflow's evaluate functionality for metrics that use an LLM to generate
  metric scores was restricted to a restrictive list of providers (defaulted to use either `OpenAI` public APIs, `Databricks` endpoints, or `AzureOpenAI`
  endpoints. ([#13715](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13715), [#13717](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13717), [@B-Step62](https://github.com/B-Step62))

  This restriction has been corrected to support:

  - **OpenAI-compatible endpoints** - whether you're running a proxy to `OpenAI` or are creating a self-hosted LLM that conforms to the `OpenAI` specification
    standards, you will now be able to define a `proxy_url` and specify `extra_headers` to pass along with your evaluation requests to use MLflow evaluate
    to interface to whatever LLM you would like to use as a judge.
  - **Additional Providers** - We now support using `Anthropic`, `Bedrock`, `Mistral`, and `TogetherAI` in addition to `OpenAI` for viable LLM interfaces for
    judges. Custom proxy urls and headers are supported for these additional provider interfaces as well.

- **Enhanced Trace UI** - From enhanced span content rendering using markdown to a standardized span component structure, MLflow's trace UI has undergone
  a significant overhaul to bring usability and quality of life updates to the experience of auditing and investigating the contents of GenAI traces. ([#13685](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13685), [#13357](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13357), [#13242](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13242), [@daniellok-db](https://github.com/daniellok-db))

- **DSPy flavor** - MLflow now supports logging, loading, and tracing of `DSPy` models, broadening the support for advanced GenAI authoring within MLflow. ([#13131](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13131), [#13279](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13279), [#13369](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13369), [#13345](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13345), [@chenmoneygithub](https://github.com/chenmoneygithub)), ([#13543](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13543), [@B-Step62](https://github.com/B-Step62))

- **Detection of Environment Variable dependencies** - As a helpful reminder for when you are deploying models, MLflow will now record detected environment variables that are set
  within your model logging environment and provider reminders to set these values when deploying. In addition to this, updates have been made to the pre-deployment validation
  utility `mlflow.models.predict` to include required environment variables to the subprocess serving simulation to ensure that you can validate your model's deployment compatibility
  prior to deployment. ([#13584](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13584), [@serena-ruan](https://github.com/serena-ruan))
