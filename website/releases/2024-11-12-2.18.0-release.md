We are excited to announce the release of MLflow 2.18.0! This release includes a number of significant features, enhancements, and bug fixes.

### Python Version Update

Python 3.8 is now at an end-of-life point. With official support being dropped for this legacy version, **MLflow now requires Python 3.9**
as a minimum supported version.

> Note: If you are currently using MLflow's `ChatModel` interface for authoring custom GenAI applications, please ensure that you
> have read the future breaking changes section below.

### Major New Features

- **ü¶∫ Fluent API Thread/Process Safety** - MLflow's fluent APIs for tracking and the model registry have been overhauled to add support for both thread and multi-process safety. You are now no longer forced to use the Client APIs for managing experiments, runs, and logging from within multiprocessing and threaded applications. ([#13456](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13456), [#13419](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13419), [@WeichenXu123](https://github.com/WeichenXu123))

- **üß© DSPy flavor** - MLflow now supports logging, loading, and tracing of `DSPy` models, broadening the support for advanced GenAI authoring within MLflow. Check out the [MLflow DSPy Flavor](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/dspy/index.html) documentation to get started! ([#13131](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13131), [#13279](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13279), [#13369](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13369), [#13345](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13345), [@chenmoneygithub](https://github.com/chenmoneygithub), [#13543](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13543), [#13800](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13800), [#13807](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13807), [@B-Step62](https://github.com/B-Step62), [#13289](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13289), [@michael-berk](https://github.com/michael-berk))

- **üñ•Ô∏è Enhanced Trace UI** - [MLflow Tracing](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html)'s UI has undergone
  a significant overhaul to bring usability and quality of life updates to the experience of auditing and investigating the contents of GenAI traces, from enhanced span content rendering using markdown to a standardized span component structure. ([#13685](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13685), [#13357](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13357), [#13242](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13242), [@daniellok-db](https://github.com/daniellok-db))

- **üöÑ New Tracing Integrations** - [MLflow Tracing](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html) now supports **DSPy**, **LiteLLM**, and **Google Gemini**, enabling a one-line, fully automated tracing experience. These integrations unlock enhanced observability across a broader range of industry tools. Stay tuned for upcoming integrations and updates! ([#13801](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13801), [@TomeHirata](https://github.com/TomeHirata), [#13585](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13585), [@B-Step62](https://github.com/B-Step62))

- **üìä Expanded LLM-as-a-Judge Support** - MLflow now enhances its evaluation capabilities with support for additional providers, including `Anthropic`, `Bedrock`, `Mistral`, and `TogetherAI`, alongside existing providers like `OpenAI`. Users can now also configure proxy endpoints or self-hosted LLMs that follow the provider API specs by using the new `proxy_url` and `extra_headers` options. Visit the [LLM-as-a-Judge](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/llm-evaluate/index.html#llm-as-a-judge-metrics) documentation for more details! ([#13715](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13715), [#13717](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13717), [@B-Step62](https://github.com/B-Step62))

- **‚è∞ Environment Variable Detection** - As a helpful reminder for when you are deploying models, MLflow now detects and reminds users of environment variables set during model logging, ensuring they are configured for deployment. In addition to this, the `mlflow.models.predict` utility has also been updated to include these variables in serving simulations, improving pre-deployment validation. ([#13584](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13584), [@serena-ruan](https://github.com/serena-ruan))

### Breaking Changes to ChatModel Interface

- **ChatModel Interface Updates** - As part of a broader unification effort within MLflow and services that rely on or deeply integrate
  with MLflow's GenAI features, we are working on a phased approach to making a consistent and standard interface for custom GenAI
  application development and usage. In the first phase (planned for release in the next few releases of MLflow), we are marking
  several interfaces as deprecated, as they will be changing. These changes will be:

  - **Renaming of Interfaces**:
    - `ChatRequest` ‚Üí `ChatCompletionRequest` to provide disambiguation for future planned request interfaces.
    - `ChatResponse` ‚Üí `ChatCompletionResponse` for the same reason as the input interface.
    - `metadata` fields within `ChatRequest` and `ChatResponse` ‚Üí `custom_inputs` and `custom_outputs`, respectively.
  - **Streaming Updates**:
    - `predict_stream` will be updated to enable true streaming for custom GenAI applications. Currently, it returns a generator with synchronous outputs from predict. In a future release, it will return a generator of `ChatCompletionChunks`, enabling asynchronous streaming. While the API call structure will remain the same, the returned data payload will change significantly, aligning with LangChain‚Äôs implementation.
  - **Legacy Dataclass Deprecation**:
    - Dataclasses in `mlflow.models.rag_signatures` will be deprecated, merging into unified `ChatCompletionRequest`, `ChatCompletionResponse`, and `ChatCompletionChunks`.
