## 2.19.0 (2024-12-11)

We are excited to announce the release of MLflow 2.19.0! This release includes a number of significant features, enhancements, and bug fixes.

### Major New Features

- **ChatModel enhancements** - [ChatModel](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/chat-model-guide/index.html) now adopts `ChatCompletionRequest` and `ChatCompletionResponse` as its new schema. The `predict_stream` interface uses `ChatCompletionChunk` to deliver true streaming responses. Additionally, the `custom_inputs` and `custom_outputs` fields in ChatModel now utilize `AnyType`, enabling support for a wider variety of data types. **Note:** In a future version of MLflow, `ChatParams` (and by extension, `ChatCompletionRequest`) will have the default values for `n`, `temperature`, and `stream` removed. (#13782, #13857, @stevenchen-db)

- **Tracing improvements** - [MLflow Tracing](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html) now supports both automatic and manual tracing for DSPy, LlamaIndex and Langchain flavors. Tracing feature is also auto-enabled for mlflow evaluation for all supported flavors. (#13790, #13793, #13795, #13897, @B-Step62)

- **New Tracing Integrations** - [MLflow Tracing](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html) now supports **CrewAI** and **Anthropic**, enabling a one-line, fully automated tracing experience. (#13903, @TomeHirata, #13851, @gabrielfu)

- **Any Type in model signature** - MLflow now supports [AnyType](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model/signatures.html#supported-data-types) in model signature. It can be used to host any data types that were not supported before. (#13766, @serena-ruan)

Other Features:

- [Tracking] Add `update_current_trace` API for adding tags to an active trace. (#13828, @B-Step62)
- [Deployments] Update databricks deployments to support AI gateway & additional update endpoints (#13513, @djliden)
- [Models] Support uv in mlflow.models.predict (#13824, @serena-ruan)
- [Models] Add type hints support including pydantic models (#13924, @serena-ruan)
- [Tracking] Add the `trace.search_spans()` method for searching spans within traces (#13984, @B-Step62)

Bug fixes:

- [Tracking] Allow passing in spark connect dataframes in mlflow evaluate API (#13889, @WeichenXu123)
- [Tracking] Fix `mlflow.end_run` inside a MLflow run context manager (#13888, @WeichenXu123)
- [Scoring] Fix spark_udf conditional check on remote spark-connect client or Databricks Serverless (#13827, @WeichenXu123)
- [Models] Allow changing max_workers for built-in LLM-as-a-Judge metrics (#13858, @B-Step62)
- [Models] Support saving all langchain runnables using code-based logging (#13821, @serena-ruan)
- [Model Registry] return empty array when DatabricksSDKModelsArtifactRepository.list_artifacts is called on a file (#14027, @shichengzhou-db)
- [Tracking] Stringify param values in client.log_batch() (#14015, @B-Step62)
- [Tracking] Remove deprecated squared parameter (#14028, @B-Step62)
- [Tracking] Fix request/response field in the search_traces output (#13985, @B-Step62)
