## 2.19.0 (2024-12-11)

We are excited to announce the release of MLflow 2.19.0! This release includes a number of significant features, enhancements, and bug fixes.

### Major New Features

- **ChatModel enhancements** - [ChatModel](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/chat-model-guide/index.html) now adopts `ChatCompletionRequest` and `ChatCompletionResponse` as its new schema. The `predict_stream` interface uses `ChatCompletionChunk` to deliver true streaming responses. Additionally, the `custom_inputs` and `custom_outputs` fields in ChatModel now utilize `AnyType`, enabling support for a wider variety of data types. **Note:** In a future version of MLflow, `ChatParams` (and by extension, `ChatCompletionRequest`) will have the default values for `n`, `temperature`, and `stream` removed. ([#13782](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13782), [#13857](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13857), [@stevenchen-db](https://github.com/stevenchen-db))

- **Tracing improvements** - [MLflow Tracing](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html) now supports both automatic and manual tracing for DSPy, LlamaIndex and Langchain flavors. Tracing feature is also auto-enabled for mlflow evaluation for all supported flavors. ([#13790](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13790), [#13793](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13793), [#13795](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13795), [#13897](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13897), [@B-Step62](https://github.com/B-Step62))

- **New Tracing Integrations** - [MLflow Tracing](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html) now supports **CrewAI** and **Anthropic**, enabling a one-line, fully automated tracing experience. ([#13903](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13903), [@TomeHirata](https://github.com/TomeHirata), [#13851](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13851), [@gabrielfu](https://github.com/gabrielfu))

- **Any Type in model signature** - MLflow now supports [AnyType](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model/signatures.html#supported-data-types) in model signature. It can be used to host any data types that were not supported before. ([#13766](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13766), [@serena-ruan](https://github.com/serena-ruan))
