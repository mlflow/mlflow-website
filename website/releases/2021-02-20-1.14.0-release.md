We are happy to announce the availability of [MLflow 1.14.0](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v1.14.0)!

In addition to bug and documentation fixes, MLflow 1.14.0 includes the following features and improvements:

- MLflow's model inference APIs (`mlflow.pyfunc.predict`), built-in model serving tools (`mlflow models serve`), and model signatures now support tensor inputs. In particular, MLflow now provides built-in support for scoring PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, ONNX, and Gluon models with tensor inputs. For more information, see https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#deploy-mlflow-models (#3808, #3894, #4084, #4068 @wentinghu; #4041 @tomasatdatabricks, #4099, @arjundc-db)
- Add new `mlflow.shap.log_explainer`, `mlflow.shap.load_explainer` APIs for logging and loading `shap.Explainer` instances (#3989, @vivekchettiar)
- The MLflow Python client is now available with a reduced dependency set via the `mlflow-skinny` PyPI package (#4049, @eedeleon)
- Add new `RequestHeaderProvider` plugin interface for passing custom request headers with REST API requests made by the MLflow Python client (#4042, @jimmyxu-db)
- `mlflow.keras.log_model` now saves models in the TensorFlow SavedModel format by default instead of the older Keras H5 format (#4043, @harupy)
- `mlflow_log_model` now supports logging MLeap models in R (#3819, @yitao-li)
- Add `mlflow.pytorch.log_state_dict`, `mlflow.pytorch.load_state_dict` for logging and loading PyTorch state dicts (#3705, @shrinath-suresh)
- `mlflow gc` can now garbage-collect artifacts stored in S3 (#3958, @sklingel)
