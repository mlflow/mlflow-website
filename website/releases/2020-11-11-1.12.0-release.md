We are happy to announce the availability of [MLflow 1.12.0](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v1.12.0)!

In addition to bug and documentation fixes, MLflow 1.12.0 includes several major features and improvements, in particular a number of improvements to MLflow's Pytorch integrations and autologging:

PyTorch

- `mlflow.pytorch.log_model`, `mlflow.pytorch.load_model` now support logging/loading TorchScript models (#3557, @shrinath-suresh)
- `mlflow.pytorch.log_model` supports passing `requirements_file` & `extra_files` arguments to log additional artifacts along with a model (#3436, @shrinath-suresh)

Autologging

- Add universal `mlflow.autolog` which enables autologging for all supported integrations (#3561, #3590, @andrewnitu)
- Add `mlflow.pytorch.autolog` API for automatic logging of metrics, params, and models from Pytorch Lightning training (#3601, @shrinath-suresh, #3636, @karthik-77). This API is also enabled by `mlflow.autolog`.
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and LightGBM autologging now support logging model signatures and input examples (#3386, #3403, #3449, @andrewnitu)
- `mlflow.sklearn.autolog` now supports logging metrics (e.g. accuracy) and plots (e.g. confusion matrix heat map) (#3423, #3327, @willzhan-db, @harupy)
