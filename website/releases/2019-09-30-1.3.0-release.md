We are happy to announce the availability of [MLflow 1.3.0](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v1.3.0)!

In addition to several bug and documentation fixes, MLflow 1.3.0 includes the following major features and improvements:

- The Python client now supports logging & loading models using TensorFlow 2.0
- Significant performance improvements when fetching runs and experiments in MLflow servers that use SQL database-backed storage
- New `GetExperimentByName` REST API endpoint, used in the Python client to speed up `set_experiment` and `get_experiment_by_name`
- New `mlflow.delete_run`, `mlflow.delete_experiment` fluent APIs in the Python client
- New CLI command (`mlflow experiments csv`) to export runs of an experiment into a CSV
- Directories can now be logged as artifacts via `mlflow.log_artifact` in the Python fluent API
- HTML and geojson artifacts are now rendered in the run UI
- Keras autologging support for `fit_generator` Keras API
- MLflow models packaged as docker containers can be executed via Google Cloud Run
- Artifact storage configurations are propagated to containers when executing docker-based MLflow projects locally
- The Python, Java, R clients and UI now retry HTTP requests on 429 (Too Many Requests) errors
