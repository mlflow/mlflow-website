MLflow 2.14.0 includes several major features and improvements that we're very excited to announce!

### Major features:

- **MLflow Tracing**: Tracing is powerful tool designed to enhance your ability to monitor, analyze, and debug GenAI applications by allowing you to inspect the intermediate outputs generated as your application handles a request. This update comes with an automatic LangChain integration to make it as easy as possible to get started, but we've also implemented high-level fluent APIs, and low-level client APIs for users who want more control over their trace instrumentation. For more information, check out the [guide in our docs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html)!
- **Unity Catalog Integration**: The MLflow Deployments server now has an integration with Unity Catalog, allowing you to leverage registered functions as tools for enhancing your chat application. For more information, check out [this guide](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/deployments/uc_integration.html)!
- **OpenAI Autologging**: Autologging support has now been added for the OpenAI model flavor. With this feature, MLflow will automatically log a model upon calling the OpenAI API. Each time a request is made, the inputs and outputs will be logged as artifacts. Check out [the guide](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/openai/guide/index.html#openai-autologging) for more information!
