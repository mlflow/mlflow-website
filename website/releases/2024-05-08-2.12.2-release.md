MLflow 2.12.2 is a patch release that includes several bug fixes and integration improvements to existing features.

New features that are introduced in this patch release are intended to provide a foundation to further major features that will be released in the next 2 minor releases.

Features:

- [Models] Add an environment configuration flag to enable raising an exception instead of a warning for failures in model dependency inference (#11903, @BenWilson2)
- [Models] Add support for the `llm/v1/embeddings` task in the Transformers flavor to unify the input and output structures for embedding models (#11795, @B-Step62)
- [Models] Introduce model streaming return via `predict_stream()` for custom `pyfunc` models capable of returning a stream response (#11791, #11895, @WeichenXu123)
- [Evaluate] Add support for overriding the entire model evaluation judgment prompt within `mlflow.evaluate` for GenAI models (#11912, @apurva-koti)
- [Tracking] Add support for defining deployment resource metadata to configure deployment resources within `pyfunc` models (#11832, #11825, #11804, @sunishsheth2009)
- [Tracking] Add support for logging `LangChain` and custom `pyfunc` models as code (#11855, #11842, @sunishsheth2009)
- [Tracking] Modify MLflow client's behavior to read from a global asynchronous configuration state (#11778, #11780, @chenmoneygithub)
- [Tracking] Enhance system metrics data collection to include a GPU power consumption metric (#11747, @chenmoneygithub)

Bug fixes:

- [Databricks] Fix an issue where models cannot be loaded in the Databricks serverless runtime (#11758, @WeichenXu123)
- [Databricks] Fix an issue with the Databricks serverless runtime where scaled workers do not have authorization to read from the driver NFS mount (#11757, @WeichenXu123)
- [Databricks] Fix an issue in the Databricks serverless runtime where a model loaded via a `spark_udf` for inference fails due to a configuration issue (#11752, @WeichenXu123)
- [Server-infra] Upgrade the gunicorn dependency to version 22 to address a third-party security issue (#11742, @maitreyakv)

Documentation updates:

- [Docs] Fix an issue with the quickstart guide where the Keras example model is defined incorrectly (#11848, @horw)
- [Docs] Provide fixes and updates to LangChain tutorials and guides (#11802, @BenWilson2)
