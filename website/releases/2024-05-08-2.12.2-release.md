MLflow 2.12.2 is a patch release that includes several bug fixes and integration improvements to existing features.

New features that are introduced in this patch release are intended to provide a foundation to further major features that will be released in the next 2 minor releases.

Features:

- [Models] Add an environment configuration flag to enable raising an exception instead of a warning for failures in model dependency inference ([#11903](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11903), [@BenWilson2](https://github.com/BenWilson2))
- [Models] Add support for the `llm/v1/embeddings` task in the Transformers flavor to unify the input and output structures for embedding models ([#11795](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11795), [@B-Step62](https://github.com/B-Step62))
- [Models] Introduce model streaming return via `predict_stream()` for custom `pyfunc` models capable of returning a stream response ([#11791](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11791), [#11895](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11895), [@WeichenXu123](https://github.com/WeichenXu123))
- [Evaluate] Add support for overriding the entire model evaluation judgment prompt within `mlflow.evaluate` for GenAI models ([#11912](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11912), [@apurva-koti](https://github.com/apurva-koti))
- [Tracking] Add support for defining deployment resource metadata to configure deployment resources within `pyfunc` models ([#11832](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11832), [#11825](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11825), [#11804](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11804), [@sunishsheth2009](https://github.com/sunishsheth2009))
- [Tracking] Add support for logging `LangChain` and custom `pyfunc` models as code ([#11855](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11855), [#11842](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11842), [@sunishsheth2009](https://github.com/sunishsheth2009))
- [Tracking] Modify MLflow client's behavior to read from a global asynchronous configuration state ([#11778](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11778), [#11780](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11780), [@chenmoneygithub](https://github.com/chenmoneygithub))
- [Tracking] Enhance system metrics data collection to include a GPU power consumption metric ([#11747](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11747), [@chenmoneygithub](https://github.com/chenmoneygithub))

Bug fixes:

- [Models] Fix a validation issue when performing signature validation if `params` are specified ([#11838](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11838), [@WeichenXu123](https://github.com/WeichenXu123))
- [Databricks] Fix an issue where models cannot be loaded in the Databricks serverless runtime ([#11758](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11758), [@WeichenXu123](https://github.com/WeichenXu123))
- [Databricks] Fix an issue with the Databricks serverless runtime where scaled workers do not have authorization to read from the driver NFS mount ([#11757](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11757), [@WeichenXu123](https://github.com/WeichenXu123))
- [Databricks] Fix an issue in the Databricks serverless runtime where a model loaded via a `spark_udf` for inference fails due to a configuration issue ([#11752](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11752), [@WeichenXu123](https://github.com/WeichenXu123))
- [Server-infra] Upgrade the gunicorn dependency to version 22 to address a third-party security issue ([#11742](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11742), [@maitreyakv](https://github.com/maitreyakv))
