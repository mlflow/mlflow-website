MLflow 3.7.0 includes several major features and improvements for GenAI Observability, Evaluation, and Prompt Management.

### Major Features

- 📝 **Experiment Prompts UI**: New prompts functionality in the experiment UI allows you to manage and search prompts directly within experiments, with support for filter strings and prompt version search in traces. ([#19156](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/19156), [#18919](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/18919), [#18906](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/18906), [@TomeHirata](https://github.com/TomeHirata))
- 💬 **Multi-turn Evaluation Support**: Enhanced `mlflow.genai.evaluate` now supports multi-turn conversations, enabling comprehensive assessment of conversational AI applications with DataFrame and list inputs. ([#18971](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/18971), [@AveshCSingh](https://github.com/AveshCSingh))
- ⚖️ **Trace Comparison**: New side-by-side comparison view in the Traces UI allows you to analyze and debug LLM application behavior across different runs, making it easier to identify regressions and improvements. ([#17138](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/17138), [@joelrobin18](https://github.com/joelrobin18))
