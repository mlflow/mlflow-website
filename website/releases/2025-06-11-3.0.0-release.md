# MLflow 3.0

The open source MLflow community has reached a major milestone. Today, we're releasing MLflow 3.0, which brings production-ready generative AI capabilities to the platform that millions of developers trust for ML operations.

This isn't just another feature update. MLflow 3.0 fundamentally expands what's possible with open source ML tooling, addressing the observability and quality challenges that have made GenAI deployment feel like a leap of faith.

## Major Updates

### ðŸŽ¯ MLflow `LoggedModel`

MLflow 3.0 introduces a refined architecture with the new `LoggedModel` entity as a first-class citizen, moving beyond the traditional run-centric approach. This enables better organization and comparison of GenAI agents, deep learning checkpoints, and model variants across experiments.

Learn more about [MLflow `LoggedModel`](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/data-model/#mlflow-loggedmodel-model-management) in the documentation.

### ðŸ”— Strong Lineage Support

Enhanced model tracking provides comprehensive lineage between models, runs, traces, prompts, and evaluation metrics. The new model-centric design allows you to group traces and metrics from interactive queries and automated evaluation jobs, enabling rich comparisons across model versions.

### âš¡ Prompt Optimization

The MLflow Prompt Registry now includes prompt optimization capabilities, allowing you to automatically improve prompts using evaluation feedback and labeled datasets. This includes versioning, tracking, and systematic prompt engineering workflows.

Learn more about [prompt optimization](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/prompt-version-mgmt/prompt-registry/optimize-prompts) in the documentation.

### ðŸ“š Revamped Documentation

The MLflow documentation has been completely revamped and is now structured around two primary user journeys: GenAI development and classic machine learning workflows. The new modular organization features dedicated sections for getting started, GenAI-specific capabilities (such as LLMs, prompt engineering, and tracing), and traditional ML features including experiment tracking, model registry, deployment, and evaluation.

## Other Features

**Streaming API for ResponsesAgent**: New streaming response capabilities through the ResponsesAgent class with predict_stream method, enabling real-time streaming for GenAI applications ([docs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/serving/responses-agent))

**Auto-tracing support for `PydanticAI` and `smolagents`**: Enhanced auto-tracing integrations for emerging GenAI frameworks, providing seamless observability out of the box ([`PydanticAI` docs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/integrations/listing/pydantic_ai) and [`smolagents`docs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/integrations/listing/smolagents)).

**Add `search_prompts` API for prompt registry**: New API functionality for searching and discovering prompts in the registry, making prompt management more efficient (API docs: [search_prompts](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/prompt-version-mgmt/prompt-registry/api#mlflow.search_prompts)).

**Support token tracking for OpenAI/LangChain auto-tracing**: Enhanced tracing now captures detailed token usage and cost information for better observability and cost management.

**Record environment metadata in tracing**: MLflow automatically captures standard environment metadata like source name, Git commit hash, and execution type as tags on traces ([docs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/track-environments-context/)).

**UI support for video artifacts**: The MLflow UI now supports viewing video files directly in the artifact viewer, expanding beyond traditional ML artifacts.

**and many more**: Numerous other enhancements across tracking, model registry, and UI components to improve usability, performance, and developer experience.

## Breaking Changes

MLflow 3.0 includes several breaking changes as part of improving framework consistency and performance. Key changes include removal of MLflow Recipes, fastai and mleap flavors, and various deprecated API parameters.

## Upgrade Recommendation

We recommend testing MLflow 3.0 in a separate environment before upgrading your production workflows to ensure compatibility with your existing setup.

## Getting Started

```bash
pip install mlflow>=3.0.0
```

Explore the new MLflow 3.0 documentation and try out the enhanced GenAI capabilities with our updated quickstart guides. The model-centric architecture and improved tracing make it easier than ever to build, evaluate, and deploy production-ready AI applications.
