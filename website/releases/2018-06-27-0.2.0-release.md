We are happy to announce the availability of [MLflow 0.2.0](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v0.2.0)!

- Added mlflow server to provide a remote tracking server. This is akin to mlflow ui with new options:
  - --host to allow binding to any ports ([#27](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/27), [@mdagost](https://github.com/mdagost))
  - --artifact-root to allow storing artifacts at a remote location, S3 only right now ([#78](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/78), [@mateiz](https://github.com/mateiz))
- Server now runs behind gunicorn to allow concurrent requests to be made ([#61](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/61), [@mateiz](https://github.com/mateiz))
- Tensorflow integration: we now support logging Tensorflow Models directly in the log_model API, model format, and serving APIs ([#28](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/28), [@juntai-zheng](https://github.com/juntai-zheng))
- Added experiments.list_experiments as part of experiments API ([#37](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/37), [@mparkhe](https://github.com/mparkhe))
- Improved support for unicode strings ([#79](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/79), [@smurching](https://github.com/smurching))
- Diabetes progression example dataset and training code ([#56](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/56), [@dennyglee](https://github.com/dennyglee))
- Miscellaneous bug and documentation fixes from [@Jeffwan](https://github.com/Jeffwan), [@yupbank](https://github.com/yupbank), [@ndjido](https://github.com/ndjido), [@xueyumusic](https://github.com/xueyumusic), [@manugarri](https://github.com/manugarri), [@tomasatdatabricks](https://github.com/tomasatdatabricks), [@stbof](https://github.com/stbof), [@andyk](https://github.com/andyk), [@andrewmchen](https://github.com/andrewmchen), [@jakeret](https://github.com/jakeret), [@0wu](https://github.com/0wu), [@aarondav](https://github.com/aarondav)
