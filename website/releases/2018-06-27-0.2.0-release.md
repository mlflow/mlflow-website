We are happy to announce the availability of [MLflow 0.2.0](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v0.2.0)!

- Added mlflow server to provide a remote tracking server. This is akin to mlflow ui with new options:
  - --host to allow binding to any ports (#27, @mdagost)
  - --artifact-root to allow storing artifacts at a remote location, S3 only right now (#78, @mateiz)
- Server now runs behind gunicorn to allow concurrent requests to be made (#61, @mateiz)
- Tensorflow integration: we now support logging Tensorflow Models directly in the log_model API, model format, and serving APIs (#28, @juntai-zheng)
- Added experiments.list_experiments as part of experiments API (#37, @mparkhe)
- Improved support for unicode strings (#79, @smurching)
- Diabetes progression example dataset and training code (#56, @dennyglee)
- Miscellaneous bug and documentation fixes from @Jeffwan, @yupbank, @ndjido, @xueyumusic, @manugarri, @tomasatdatabricks, @stbof, @andyk, @andrewmchen, @jakeret, @0wu, @aarondav
