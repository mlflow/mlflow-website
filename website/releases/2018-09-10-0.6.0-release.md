We are happy to announce the availability of [MLflow 0.6.0](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v0.6.0)!

MLflow 0.6.0 introduces several major features:

- A Java client API (to be published on Maven within the next day or two)
- Support for saving and serving SparkML models as MLeap for low-latency serving
- Support for tagging runs with metadata, during and after the run completion
- Support for deleting (and restoring deleted) experiments

In addition to these features, there are a host of improvements and bugfixes to the REST API, Python API, tracking UI, and documentation. Visit the [change log](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst#060-2018-09-10) to read more about the new features.
