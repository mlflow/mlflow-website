We are happy to announce the availability of [MLflow 1.15.0](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v1.15.0)!

In addition to bug and documentation fixes, MLflow 1.15.0 includes the following features and improvements:

- Add `silent=False` option to all autologging APIs, to allow suppressing MLflow warnings and logging statements during autologging setup and training (#4173, @dbczumar)
- Add `disable_for_unsupported_versions=False` option to all autologging APIs, to disable autologging for versions of ML frameworks that have not been explicitly tested against the current version of the MLflow client (#4119, @WeichenXu123)

For a comprehensive list of changes, see the [release change log](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v1.15.0), and check out the latest documentation on [mlflow.org](http://mlflow.org/).
