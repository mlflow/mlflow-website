MLflow 3.5.0 includes several major features and improvements!

### Major Features

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Job Execution Backend**: Introduced a new job execution backend infrastructure for running asynchronous tasks with individual execution pools, job search capabilities, and transient error handling. ([#17676](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/17676), [#18012](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/18012), [#18070](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/18070), [#18071](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/18071), [#18112](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/18112), [#18049](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/18049), [@WeichenXu123](https://github.com/WeichenXu123))
- üéØ **Flexible Prompt Optimization API**: Introduced a new flexible API for prompt optimization with support for model switching and the GEPA algorithm, enabling more efficient prompt tuning with fewer rollouts. See the [documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/prompt-registry/optimize-prompts/) to get started.
