We are happy to announce the availability of [MLflow 0.8.1](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v0.8.1)!
MLflow 0.8.1 introduces several significant improvements:

- Improved UI responsiveness and load time, especially when displaying experiments containing hundreds to thousands of runs.

- Improved visualizations, including interactive scatter plots for MLflow run comparisons.

- Expanded support for scoring Python models as Spark UDFs. For more information, see the [updated documentation for this feature](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#export-a-python-function-model-as-an-apache-spark-udf).

- By default, saved models will now include a Conda environment specifying all of the dependencies necessary for loading them in a new environment.

- MLflow projects can now be run from ZIP files.

The release includes additional bugfixes and improvements across the Python client, tracking UI, and documentation. Visit the [change log](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst#081-2018-12-21) to read more about the new features.
