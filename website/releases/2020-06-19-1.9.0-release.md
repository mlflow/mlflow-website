We are happy to announce the availability of [MLflow 1.9.0](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v1.9.0)!

In addition to bug and documentation fixes, MLflow 1.9.0 includes the following major features and improvements:

- `log_model` and `save_model` APIs now support saving model signatures (the model's input and output schema)
  and example input along with the model itself (#2698, #2775, @tomasatdatabricks). Model signatures are used
  to reorder and validate input fields when scoring/serving models using the pyfunc flavor, `mlflow models`
  CLI commands, or `mlflow.pyfunc.spark_udf` (#2920, @tomasatdatabricks and @aarondav)
- Introduce fastai model persistence and autologging APIs under `mlflow.fastai` (#2619, #2689 @antoniomdk)
- Add pluggable `mlflow.deployments` API and CLI for deploying models to custom serving tools, e.g. RedisAI
  (#2327, @hhsecond)
- Add plugin interface for executing MLflow projects against custom backends (#2566, @jdlesage)
- Enable viewing PDFs logged as artifacts from the runs UI (#2859, @ankmathur96)
- Significant performance and scalability improvements to metric comparison and scatter plots in
  the UI (#2447, @mjlbach)

For a comprehensive list of changes, see the [release change log](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v1.9.0), and check out the latest documentation on [mlflow.org](http://mlflow.org/).
