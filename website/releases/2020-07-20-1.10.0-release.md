We are happy to announce the availability of [MLflow 1.10.0](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v1.10.0)!

In addition to bug and documentation fixes, MLflow 1.10.0 includes the following features and improvements:

- `MlflowClient.transition_model_version_stage` now supports an
  `archive_existing_versions` argument for archiving existing staging or production model
  versions when transitioning a new model version to staging or production (#3095, @harupy)
- Added `set_registry_uri`, `get_registry_uri` APIs. Setting the model registry URI causes
  fluent APIs like `mlflow.register_model` to communicate with the model registry at the specified
  URI (#3072, @sueann)
- Added paginated `MlflowClient.search_registered_models` API (#2939, #3023, #3027 @ankitmathur-db; #2966, @mparkhe)
- Added syntax highlighting when viewing text files (YAML etc) in the MLflow runs UI (#3041, @harupy)

For a comprehensive list of changes, see the [release change log](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v1.10.0), and check out the latest documentation on [mlflow.org](http://mlflow.org/).
