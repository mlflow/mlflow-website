MLflow 2.11.0 includes several major features and improvements

With the MLflow 2.11.0 release, we're excited to bring a series of large and impactful features that span both GenAI and Deep Learning use cases.

### New Deep Learning Focused Improvements in the MLflow UI

The MLflow Tracking UI got an overhaul to better support the review and comparison of training runs for Deep Learning workloads. From grouping to large-scale metric plotting throughout
the iterations of a DL model's training cycle, there are a large number of quality of life improvements to enhance your Deep Learning MLOps workflow.

### Support for PEFT, unrestrictive Pipeline logging, and weight-less model logging in transformers

Support for the popular [PEFT](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/transformers/guide/index.html#peft-models-in-mlflow-transformers-flavor) library from HuggingFace is now available
in the `mlflow.transformers` flavor. In addition to PEFT support, we've removed the restrictions on Pipeline types
that can be logged to MLflow, as well as the ability to, when developing and testing models, log a transformers pipeline without copying foundational model weights. These
enhancements strive to make the transformers flavor more useful for cutting-edge GenAI models, new pipeline types, and to simplify the development process of prompt engineering, fine-tuning,
and to make iterative development faster and cheaper. Give the updated flavor a try today! ([#11240](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11240), [@B-Step62](https://github.com/B-Step62))

### Autologging for TensorFlow and PyTorch now supports checkpointing of model weights

We've added support to both [PyTorch](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pytorch.html#mlflow.pytorch.autolog) and
[TensorFlow](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.tensorflow.html#mlflow.tensorflow.autolog) for automatic model weights checkpointing (including resumption from a
previous state) for the auto logging implementations within both flavors. This highly requested feature allows you to automatically configure long-running Deep Learning training
runs to keep a safe storage of your best epoch, eliminating the risk of a failure late in training from losing the state of the model optimization. ([#11197](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11197), [#10935](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10935), [@WeichenXu123](https://github.com/WeichenXu123))

### ChatModel interface for a unified Chat experience with pyfunc models

We've added a new interface to Pyfunc for GenAI workloads. The new `ChatModel` interface allows for interacting with a deployed GenAI chat model as you would with any other provider.
The simplified interface (no longer requiring conformance to a Pandas DataFrame input type) strives to unify the API interface experience. ([#10820](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10820), [@daniellok-db](https://github.com/daniellok-db))

### Keras 3 support in MLflow

We now support Keras 3. This large overhaul of the Keras library introduced new fundamental changes to how Keras integrates with different DL frameworks, bringing with it
a host of new functionality and interoperability. To learn more, see the [Keras 3.0 Tutorial](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/deep-learning/keras/quickstart/quickstart_keras.html)
to start using the updated model flavor today! ([#10830](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10830), [@chenmoneygithub](https://github.com/chenmoneygithub))

### Mistral AI models are now available in the MLflow Deployments Server

[Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/) has been added as a native [provider](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/deployments/index.html#providers) for the MLflow Deployments Server. You can
now create proxied connections to the Mistral AI services for completions and embeddings with their powerful GenAI models. ([#11020](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11020), [@thnguyendn](https://github.com/thnguyendn))

### MLflow now supports the OpenAI 1.x SDK

We've added compatibility support for the OpenAI 1.x SDK. Whether you're using an OpenAI LLM for model evaluation or calling OpenAI within a LangChain model, you'll now be able to
utilize the 1.x family of the OpenAI SDK without having to point to deprecated legacy APIs. ([#11123](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11123), [@harupy](https://github.com/harupy))
