We are happy to announce the availability of [MLflow 0.4.1](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v0.4.1)!

MLflow 0.4.1 offers some improvements and minor bug fixes:

- [Projects] MLflow will use the conda installation directory given by the $MLFLOW_CONDA_HOME if specified (e.g. running conda commands by invoking "$MLFLOW_CONDA_HOME/bin/conda"), defaulting to running "conda" otherwise.
- [UI] Show GitHub links in the UI for projects run from http(s):// GitHub URLs (#235, @smurching)

Visit the [change log](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst#041-2018-08-03) to read about the new features.
