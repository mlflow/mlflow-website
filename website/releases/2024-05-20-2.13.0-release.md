MLflow 2.13.0 includes several major features and improvements

With this release, we're happy to introduce several features that enhance the usability of MLflow broadly across a range of use cases.

### Major Features and Improvements:

- **Streamable Python Models**: The newly introduced `predict_stream` API for Python Models allows for custom model implementations that support the return of a generator object, permitting full customization for GenAI applications.

- **Enhanced Code Dependency Inference**: A new feature for automatically inferrring code dependencies based on detected dependencies within a model's implementation. As a supplement to the `code_paths` parameter, the introduced `infer_model_code_paths` option when logging a model will determine which additional code modules are needed in order to ensure that your models can be loaded in isolation, deployed, and reliably stored.

- **Standardization of MLflow Deployment Server**: Outputs from the Deployment Server's endpoints now conform to OpenAI's interfaces to provide a simpler integration with commonly used services.

Features:

- [Deployments] Update the MLflow Deployment Server interfaces to be OpenAI compatible (#12003, @harupy)

- [Model Registry] Enhance retry logic and credential refresh to mitigate cloud provider token expiration failures when uploading or downloading artifacts (#11614, @artjen)
- [Artifacts / Databricks] Add enhanced lineage tracking for models loaded from Unity Catalog (#11305, @shichengzhou-db)
- [Tracking] Add resourcing metadata to Pyfunc models to aid in model serving environment configuration (#11832, @sunishsheth2009)
- [Tracking] Enhance LangChain signature inference for models as code (#11855, @sunishsheth2009)
