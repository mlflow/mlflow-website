We are happy to announce the availability of [MLflow 1.7.0](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v1.7.0)!

In addition to bug and documentation fixes, MLflow 1.7.0 includes the following major changes:

- Support for Python 2 is deprecated and will be dropped in a future release. At that point,
  existing Python 2 workflows that use MLflow will continue to work without modification, but
  Python 2 users will no longer get access to the latest MLflow features and bugfixes.

- Breaking changes to Model Registry REST APIs
  - Model Registry REST APIs have been updated to be more consistent with the other MLflow APIs
    and are intended to be stable until the next major version.
  - Python and Java client APIs for Model Registry are backward compatible and have been updated
    to use the new REST APIs.

In addition several UI and and backend features were added in version 1.7.0. For a comprehensive list of changes, see the [release change log](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v1.7.0), and check out the latest documentation on [mlflow.org](https://mlflow.org/).
