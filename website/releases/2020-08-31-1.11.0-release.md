- Registered model & model version creation APIs now support specifying an initial `description` (#3271, @sueann)
- The R `mlflow_log_model` and `mlflow_load_model` APIs now support XGBoost models (#3085, @lorenzwalthert)

- Added section for visualizing and comparing model schemas to model version and model-version-comparison UIs (#3209, @zhidongqu-db)
- Enhanced support for using the model registry across Databricks workspaces: support for registering models to a Databricks workspace from outside the workspace (#3119, @sueann), tracking run-lineage of these models (#3128, #3164, @ankitmathur-db; #3187, @harupy), and calling `mlflow.<flavor>.load_model` against remote Databricks model registries (#3330, @sueann)

- UI support for archiving existing staging/production versions of a model when transitioning a new model version to staging/production (#3134, @harupy)
