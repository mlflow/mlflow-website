## 2.17.0 (2024-09-26)

MLflow 2.17.0rc0 is a release candidate for 2.17.0. To install, run the following command:

```sh
pip install mlflow==2.17.0rc0
```

We are excited to announce the release of MLflow 2.17.0. This release includes several enhancements to extend the
functionality of MLflow's `ChatModel` interface to further extend its versatility for handling custom GenAI application use cases.
We're also starting the work on improving both the utility and the versatility of MLflow's evaluate functionality for GenAI,
initially with support for callable GenAI evaluation metrics.

### Major Features and notifications

- **ChatModel enhancements** - As the GenAI-focused 'cousin' of `PythonModel`, `ChatModel` is getting some sizable functionality
  extensions. From native support for tool calling (a requirement for creating a custom agent), simpler conversions to the
  internal dataclass constructs needed to interface with `ChatModel` via the introduction of `from_dict` methods to all data structures,
  the addition of a `metadata` field to allow for full input payload customization, handling of the new `refusal` response type, to the
  inclusion of the interface type to the response structure to allow for greater integration compatibility.
  ([#13191](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13191), [#13180](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13180), [#13143](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13143), [@daniellok-db](https://github.com/daniellok-db), [#13102](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13102), [#13071](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13071), [@BenWilson2](https://github.com/BenWilson2))

- **Callable GenAI Evaluation Metrics** - As the intial step in a much broader expansion of the functionalities of `mlflow.evaluate` for
  GenAI use cases, we've converted the GenAI evaluation metrics to be callable. This allows you to use them directly in packages that support
  callable GenAI evaluation metrics, as well as making it simpler to debug individual responses when prototyping solutions. ([#13144](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13144), [@serena-ruan](https://github.com/serena-ruan))

- **Audio file support in the MLflow UI** - You can now directly 'view' audio files that have been logged and listen to them from within the MLflow UI's
  artifact viewer pane.

- **MLflow AI Gateway is no longer deprecated** - We've decided to revert our deprecation for the AI Gateway feature. We had renamed it to the
  MLflow Deployments Server, but have reconsidered and reverted the naming and namespace back to the original configuration.
