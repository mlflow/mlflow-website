We're excited to announce MLflow 3.10.0, which includes several notable updates:

**Major New Features**:

🏢 **Organization Support in MLflow Tracking Server**: MLflow now supports multi-workspace environments. Users can organize experiments, models, prompts, with a coarser level of unit and logically isolate them in a single tracking server. ([#20702](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/20702), [#20657](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/20657), [@mprahl](https://github.com/mprahl), [@Gkrumbach07](https://github.com/Gkrumbach07), [@B-Step62](https://github.com/B-Step62))

💬 **Multi-turn Evaluation & Conversation Simulation**: MLflow now supports multi-turn evaluation, including evaluating existing conversations with session-level scorers and simulating conversations to test new versions of your agent, without the toil of regenerating conversations. Use the session-level scorers introduced in MLflow 3.8.0 and the brand new session UIs to evaluate the quality of your conversational agents and enable automatic scoring to monitor quality as traces are ingested. ([#20243](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/20243), [#20377](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/20377), [#20289](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/20289), [@smoorjani](https://github.com/smoorjani))

💰 **Trace Cost Tracking**: Gain visibility into your LLM spending! MLflow now automatically extracts model information from LLM spans and calculates costs, with a new UI that renders model and cost data directly in your trace views. ([#20327](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/20327), [#20330](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/20330), [@serena-ruan](https://github.com/serena-ruan))

🎯 **Navigation bar redesign**: We've redesigned the navigation to provide a frictionless experience. A new workflow type selector in the top-level navbar lets you quickly switch between GenAI and Classical ML contexts, with streamlined sidebars that reduce visual clutter. ([#20158](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/20158), [#20160](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/20160), [#20161](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/20161), [#20699](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/20699), [@ispoljari](https://github.com/ispoljari), [@daniellok-db](https://github.com/daniellok-db))

🎮 **MLflow Demo Experiment**: New to MLflow GenAI? With one click, launch a pre-populated demo and explore tracing, evaluation, and prompt management in action. No configuration, no code required. ([#19994](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/19994), [#19995](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/19995), [#20046](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/20046), [#20047](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/20047), [#20048](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/20048), [#20162](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/20162), [@BenWilson2](https://github.com/BenWilson2))

📊 **Gateway Usage Tracking**: Monitor your AI Gateway endpoints with detailed usage analytics. A new usage page shows request patterns and metrics, with trace ingestion that links gateway calls back to your experiments for end-to-end observability. ([#20357](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/20357), [#20358](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/20358), [#20642](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/20642), [@TomeHirata](https://github.com/TomeHirata))

⚡ **In-UI Trace Evaluation**: Users can now run custom or pre-built LLM judges directly from the traces and sessions UI. This enables quick evaluation of individual traces and individual without context switching to the python SDK. ([#20360](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/20360), [@hubertzub-db](https://github.com/hubertzub-db), [@danielseong1](https://github.com/danielseong1))
