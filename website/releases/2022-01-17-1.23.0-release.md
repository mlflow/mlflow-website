MLflow 1.23.0 includes several major features and improvements:

Features:

- [Models] Introduce an `mlflow.evaluate()` API for evaluating MLflow Models, providing performance and explainability insights. For an overview, see https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#model-evaluation (#5069, #5092, #5256, @WeichenXu123)
- [Models] `log_model()` APIs now return information about the logged MLflow Model, including artifact location, flavors, and schema (#5230, @liangz1)
- [Models] Introduce an `mlflow.models.Model.load_input_example()` Python API for loading MLflow Model input examples (#5212, @maitre-matt)
- [Models] Add a UUID field to the MLflow Model specification. MLflow Models now have a unique identifier (#5149, #5167, @WeichenXu123)
- [Models] Support passing SciPy CSC and CSR matrices as MLflow Model input examples (#5016, @WeichenXu123)

- [Models] Fix a bug where keyword arguments passed to `mlflow.pytorch.load_model()` were not applied for scripted models (#5163, @schmidt-jake)
- [Model Registry][r] Fix bug in R client `mlflow_create_model_version()` API that caused model `source` to be set incorrectly (#5185, @bramrodenburg)
- [Projects] Fix parsing behavior for Project URIs containing quotes (#5117, @dinaldoap)
- [Scoring] Use the correct 400-level error code for malformed MLflow Model Server requests (#5003, @abatomunkuev)
- [Tracking] Fix a bug where `mlflow.start_run()` modified user-supplied tags dictionary (#5191, @matheusMoreno)
