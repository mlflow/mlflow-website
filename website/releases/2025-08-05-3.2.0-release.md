MLflow 3.2.0 includes several major features and improvements

### Major New Features

- üß≠ **Tracing TypeScript SDK**: MLflow Tracing now supports the [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/master/libs/typescript), allowing developers to trace GenAI applications in TypeScript environments. ([#16871](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/16871), [@B-Step62](https://github.com/B-Step62))
- üîó **Semantic Kernel Tracing**: MLflow now provides [automatic tracing support for Semantic Kernel](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/integrations/listing/semantic_kernel/), simplifying trace capture for SK-based workflows. ([#16469](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/16469), [@michael-berk](https://github.com/michael-berk))
- üß™ **Feedback Tracking**: MLflow OSS now natively supports tracking [human feedbacks](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/assessments/feedback/), [ground truths](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/assessments/expectations/), LLM judges on traces, providing integrated quality monitoring and feedback management capabilities. ([#16743](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/16743), [@BenWilson2](https://github.com/BenWilson2))
- üñ•Ô∏è **MLflow UI Improvements**: The MLflow UI now features **a redesigned experiment home view** and includes enhancements like pagination on the model page for better usability. ([#16464](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/16464), [@frontsideair](https://github.com/frontsideair), [#15801](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/15801), [@Flametaa](https://github.com/Flametaa))
- üîç **Updated Trace UI**: The Trace UI now has image support when rendering chat messages for OpenAI, Langchain, and Anthropic! Additionally, we're introducing a "summary view" which is a simplified, flat representation of the important spans in a trace. The full detail view is still available in a separate tab.
- üõ°Ô∏è **PII Masking in Tracing**: Added support for [masking personally identifiable information (PII) via a custom span post-processor](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/observe-with-traces/masking). ([#16344](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/16344), [@B-Step62](https://github.com/B-Step62))
- üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏è **Polars Dataset Support**: MLflow now supports [Polars datasets](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/ml/dataset/#dataset), expanding compatibility with performant DataFrame libraries. ([#13006](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/13006), [@AlpAribal](https://github.com/AlpAribal))

### üìä Usage Tracking (New in 3.2.0)

- Starting with version 3.2.0, MLflow will begin collecting anonymized usage data about how core features of the platform are used. This data contains **no sensitive or personally identifiable information**, and users can opt out of data collection at any time. Check [MLflow documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/community/usage-tracking/) for more details.
