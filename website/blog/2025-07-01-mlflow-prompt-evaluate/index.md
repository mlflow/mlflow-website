Building GenAI tools presents a unique set of challenges. As we evaluate accuracy, iterate on prompts, and enable collaboration, we often encounter bottlenecks that slow down our progress toward production.

In this blog, we explore how MLflow's GenAI capabilities help us streamline development and unlock value for both technical and non-technical contributors when building an LLM-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool.

## What is OCR?

Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, is the process of extracting text from scanned documents and images. The resulting text is machine-encoded, editable, and searchable, unlocking a wide range of downstream use cases.

Here, we leverage multi-modal LLMs to extract formatted text from scanned documents. Unlike traditional OCR tools such as PyTesseract, LLM-based methods offer greater flexibility for complex layouts, handwritten content, and context-aware extraction. While these methods may require more computational resources and careful prompt engineering, they provide significant advantages for advanced use cases.

Fun fact: The earliest form of OCR, the Optophone, was introduced in 1914 to help blind individuals read printed text without Braille.

## The Challenge

We face several recurring challenges when building an LLM-based OCR application.

**Prompt Iteration and Versioning:** Prompts need to be updated and tweaked to improve extraction quality. A new prompt can introduce performance regression, but we do not save the old version. Without rigorous versioning, it's hard to roll back or compare.

**Debugging Unexpected Results:** Unexpected results may show up periodically in our OCR attempts. We need a way to understand why. Without detailed traceability, it is difficult to diagnose whether the issue is with the prompt, the model, or the data (e.g., a new document strucutre).

**Evaluating and Comparing Models:** Accuracy in OCR can mean many things. We may want to measure correct field extraction, formatting, or even business logic compliance. In order to compare different model or prompt strategies, we need a way to define and track what matters.

MLflow addresses these directly in our workflow.

## OCR Use Case:

Our task is to create a document parsing tool for text extraction (OCR) using LLMs, using MLflow features to address our challenges. The data consists of scanned documents and their corresponding text extracted as JSON.

We use the [FUNSD dataset](https://guillaumejaume.github.io/FUNSD/), which contains around 200 fully annotated forms, structured as semantic entity labels and word groupings.

Example:

![Annotated form example](/img/blog/prompt-evaluate/word_grouping_semantic_entity_labeling.png)

```
{
        "form": [
        {
            "id": 0,
            "text": "Registration No.",
            "box": [94,169,191,186],
            "linking": [
                [0,1]
            ],
            "label": "question",
            "words": [
                {
                    "text": "Registration",
                    "box": [94,169,168,186]
                },
                {
                    "text": "No.",
                    "box": [170,169,191,183]
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "id": 1,
            "text": "533",
            "box": [209,169,236,182],
            "label": "answer",
            "words": [
                {
                    "box": [209,169,236,182
                    ],
                    "text": "533"
                }
            ],
            "linking": [
                [0,1]
            ]
        }
    ]
    }
```

### 1. Set Up

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install openai mlflow tiktoken aiohttp -qU
```

**openai:** For interacting with OpenAI models and APIs  
**mlflow:** For experiment tracking, model management, and GenAI workflow tools  
**tiktoken:** For efficient tokenization, especially useful with OpenAI models  
**aiohttp:** For asynchronous HTTP requests, enabling efficient API calls

For this tutorial we use OpenAI, but the approach extends to other LLM providers.
We can prompt the user to type the OpenAI API key without echoing using getpass():

```python
import os
from getpass import getpass

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass("Your OpenAI API Key: ")
```

### 2. Observe the Data

Let's read a randomly selected annotated file. The following utils functions faciliate this task.

```python
import json
import random
from PIL import Image as im
import base64
from io import BytesIO
import pandas as pd
import re
from typing import Any

DATA_DIRECTORY = "./data" # for simplicity, a local directory
ANNOTATIONS_DIRECTORY = os.path.join(DATA_DIRECTORY, "annotations")
IMAGES_DIRECTORY = os.path.join(DATA_DIRECTORY, "images")

def _extract_qa_pairs(data: dict) -> dict:
    """Extracts question-answer pairs from OCR-style linked data."""
    qa_pairs = {}

    elements = {item["id"]: item for item in data}
    for item in data:
        if item["label"] != "question" or not item["linking"]:
            continue
        for q_id, a_id in item["linking"]:
            if q_id != item["id"]:
                continue
            answer = elements.get(a_id)
            if answer and answer["label"] == "answer":
                q_text = " ".join(w["text"] for w in item["words"])
                a_text = " ".join(w["text"] for w in answer["words"])
                qa_pairs[q_text] = a_text
    return qa_pairs

def get_json(file_name: str, directory: str = ANNOTATIONS_DIRECTORY) -> dict:
    file_name += ".json" if not file_name.endswith(".json") else file_name
    path = os.path.join(directory, file_name)
    with open(path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        contents = json.load(f)["form"]
        if isinstance(contents, list):
            if all(isinstance(page, list) for page in contents):
                flat_items = [item for page in contents for item in page]
            else:
                flat_items = contents
            return _extract_qa_pairs(flat_items)
        else:
            return _extract_qa_pairs(contents)

def get_random_files(
    directory: str = ANNOTATIONS_DIRECTORY, n: int = 1
    ) -> list[str] | str | None:
    if not os.path.exists(directory):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Directory {directory} does not exist.")

    if files := os.listdir(directory):
        selected_files = random.sample(files, k=n)
        cleaned_files = [file.rsplit(".", 1)[0] for file in selected_files]

        if len(cleaned_files) == 1:
            return cleaned_files[0]

        return cleaned_files

    return None

def get_image(
    file_name: str, directory: str = IMAGES_DIRECTORY, encode_as_str: bool = False
) -> bytes:
    file_name += ".png" if not file_name.endswith(".png") else file_name
    path = os.path.join(directory, file_name)
    with open(path, "rb") as f:
        file = f.read()
        compressed = _compress_image(path)

        if encode_as_str:
            return base64.b64encode(compressed).decode("utf-8")
        else:
            return compressed

def _compress_image(file_path: str, quality: int = 40, max_size: tuple[int, int] = (1000, 1000)) -> bytes:
    """Compresses an image by resizing and converting to JPEG with given quality."""
    with im.open(file_path) as img:
        img = img.convert("RGB")
        img.thumbnail(max_size)
        buf = BytesIO()
        img.save(buf, format="JPEG", quality=quality)
        return buf.getvalue()

def clean_keys(key: str) -> str:
    """Remove unwanted characters and convert to upper case."""
    key = re.sub(r'[^\w\s\-_]', '', key).upper()
    return key

def normalize_json_keys(json_obj: Any) -> Any:

    if isinstance(json_obj, dict):
        return {clean_keys(k): normalize_json_keys(v) for k, v in json_obj.items()}
    elif isinstance(json_obj, list) or isinstance(json_obj, pd.Series):
        return [normalize_json_keys(item) for item in json_obj]
    else:
        return json_obj
```

Letâ€™s take a moment to break down the `_extract_qa_pairs` function:

1. We create a look-up dictionary - qa_pairs
2. We identify "question" items that have linked answer pair(s) in the form of (q_id, a_id)
3. We construct question-answer pairs by joining the individual words

We can then call `get_json` to fetch the OCR-identified question/answer structure based on the form image data.

Similarly, `get_image` can serve as a utils function that reads an image file from a specified path and resizes or converts it into a JPEG with a defined quality setting. To normalise and clean up any JSON key strings, we can use `normalise_json_keys`.

```python
from IPython.display import Image, display
import random

random_file = get_random_files()
image_bytes = get_image(random_file)
get_json(random_file)

```

### 3. MLflow Tracking, Autolog and Tracing

Before we make a call to OpenAI, we need to set up [MLflow Tracking](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/ml/tracking) to ensure every experiment, prompt, and result is recorded and traceable.

We will also enable [MLflow Autolog](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/ml/tracking/autolog) to simplify the tracking process by reducing the need for manual log statements. Metrics, params, artifacts, and other useful information are logged automatically.

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.set_tracking_uri("./mlruns")
mlflow.set_experiment("ocr-initial-experiment")
mlflow.openai.autolog()
```

[MLflow Tracing](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/) provides us with end-to-end observability. We gain a comprehensive view of each step from prompt construction and model inference to tool calls and final outputs. If we notice various failed attemped in our OCR tool, we can use the MLflow UI to inspect traces, compare inputs and outputs, and identify whether the issue is with the prompt, the model, or the data structure

In order to access the MLflow UI, we need to run the following. The UI will start on `http://localhost:5000` by default:

```bash
mlflow ui
```

![MLflow UI showing the tracing for each LLM execution](/img/blog/prompt-evaluate/eval_traces.png)

### 4. Loading inputs and Prompting

We start by defining a system prompt for extracting the contents of the images into lists of "questions" and "answers" using an LLM. We will use a "first pass" prompt, deliberately made short and minimally descriptive so that subsequent improvements can be made later on. These are tracked under the MLflow experiment runs when the LLM completion calls are invoked for each image file.

```python

_files = get_random_files(n=5)
images = [get_image(file, encode_as_str=True) for file in _files]
jsons = [get_json(file) for file in _files]

system_prompt = """You are an expert at Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Extract the questions and answers from the image."""

```

### 5. Setting up the LLM

On the OpenAI side, we initialize the client and send a prompt to the LLM, instructing it to act as an OCR expert. The expected output is a Structured Output containing a list of key-value pairs. To enforce this structure, we can define Pydantic models that validate the response format. Let's try to invoke the LLM and log the execution and see what the response looks like.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Define Pydantic models for structured output in the form of key-value pair list
class KeyValueModel(BaseModel):
    key: str
    value: str

class KeyValueList(BaseModel):
    pairs: list[KeyValueModel]

client = OpenAI()
predictions = []

def get_completion(inputs: str) -> str:
    completion = client.chat.completions.parse(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        response_format=KeyValueList,
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    { "type": "text", "text": "what's in this image?" },
                    {
                        "type": "image_url",
                        "image_url": {
                            "url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{inputs}",
                        },
                    },
                ],
            }
        ],
    )


    generated_response = {pair.key: pair.value for pair in completion.choices[0].message.parsed.pairs}
    return normalize_json_keys(generated_response)

with mlflow.start_run() as run:
    predicted = get_completion(images[0])
    print(predicted)

```

The following screenshot represents the extracted questions and answers for this specific image.

![Screenshot of LLM completion response](/img/blog/prompt-evaluate/llm_output.png)

#### Prompt Registry

Prompt engineering is central to LLM-based OCR, but creating an initial prompt is often not sufficient. In order to track which prompt version produced which results as we iterate, we will use [MLflow Prompt Registry](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/prompt-version-mgmt/prompt-registry). This allows us to register, version, and add tags to prompts.

Here's an example of a prompt template, specifically instructing the LLM to generate results in our expected format.

```python
new_template = """You are an expert at Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Extract the questions and answers from the image as a JSON object, where the keys are questions and the values are answers. If there are no questions or answers, return an empty JSON object {}.
"""
```

This initial prompt can be registered along with a prompt name, commit message, and relevant tags. Once registered, it can later be retrieved using `mlflow.genai.load_prompt()` for reuse or further improvements.

```python

# Register a new prompt for OCR question-answer extraction
new_prompt = mlflow.genai.register_prompt(
    name="ocr-question-answer",
    template=new_template,
    commit_message="Initial commit",
    tags={
        "author": "author@example.com",
        "task": "ocr",
        "language": "en",
    },
)

prompt = mlflow.genai.load_prompt(name_or_uri="ocr-question-answer", version=new_prompt.version)
system_prompt = prompt.template
```

### 6. Defining and Evaluating Performance

As ML engineers, we ensure that the OCR application using the LLM is robustly evaluated against ground truth. When evaluating an OCR system, we care about more than just accuracy. We may look at format compliance, business logic, or field extraction results. [MLflow Evaluate](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/eval-monitor/) allows us to define [built-in and custom metrics](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/api_reference/python_api/mlflow.metrics.html) that align with our use case.

While MLflow supports LLM-as-a-judge metrics, for this OCR example it's better and cheaper to use deterministic metrics. For example, we can define a custom metric `key_value_accuracy` to check if key-value pair of the generated output correctly matches that of the ground truth.

```python
from mlflow.metrics.base import MetricValue
from mlflow.models import make_metric

def batch_completion(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    result = [get_completion(image) for image in df["inputs"]]
    return pd.Series(result)


def key_value_accuracy(predictions: pd.Series, truth: pd.Series) -> MetricValue:
    """
    Calculate accuracy scores by comparing predicted JSONs with ground truth JSONs

    For each prediction-truth pair, compute the fraction of correct key-value matches.
    """
    scores = []

    # Normalize the ground truth data
    truth = truth.apply(normalize_json_keys)
    truth_normalized = normalize_json_keys(truth)

    for pred_dict, truth_dict in zip(pred, truth_normalized):
        if not isinstance(pred_dict, dict) or not isinstance(truth_dict, dict):
            scores.append(0.0)
            continue

        correct = sum(1 for k, v in truth_dict.items()
                     if k in pred_dict and pred_dict[k] == v)

        scores.append(correct / len(truth_dict) if truth_dict else 0.0)

    return MetricValue(
        scores=scores,
        aggregate_results={
            "mean": sum(scores) / len(scores) if scores else 0.0,
            "p90": sorted(scores)[int(len(scores) * 0.9)] if scores else 0.0
        }
    )

custom_key_value_accuracy = make_metric(
    eval_fn=key_value_accuracy,
    greater_is_better=True,
    name="key_value_accuracy",
)
```

After defining this custom metric, we can evaluate it over a dataframe, which includes a subset of base64-encoded images and their corresponding ground truth JSONs. Using the `batch_completion` function, we run a batch completion request on this subset, retrieving outputs in the predefined Structured Output format.

```python
results = mlflow.models.evaluate(
    model=batch_completion,
    data=pd.DataFrame({"inputs": images, "truth": jsons}),
    targets="truth",
    model_type="text",
    predictions="predictions",
    extra_metrics=[custom_key_value_accuracy]
)

print("Custom metric results:", results.metrics)
eval_table = results.tables["eval_results_table"]
print("\n Per-row scores:")
print(eval_table[['key_value_accuracy/score']])
```

![MLflow UI showing the metric key_value_accuracy computed for a single run](/img/blog/prompt-evaluate/new_eval_metrics.png)

This metric requires an exact match between the key-value pairs in the ground truth and the LLM-generated output. Upon reviewing the individual scores for each image, we observe that the model performs the worst on the last image. Specifically, one of the keys is incorrectly generated as `CHAINS - ACCEPTANCEMERCHANDISING` instead of `CHAINS ACCEPTANCE/ MERCHANDISING`. A similar pattern can be observed in other keys where different topics are improperly separated or unnecessarily paraphrased.

To address this, we can refine the prompt template by explicitly instructing the model to separate distinct topics using the `/` separator. Additionally, we can instruct the LLM to avoid paraphrasing the topics in the keys and instead focus on maintaining exactness to the image text.

```python
updated_template = """\
You are an expert at key information extraction and OCR. Extract the questions and answers from the image, where the keys are questions and the values are answers.


Question refers to a field in the form that takes in information. Answer refers to the information
that is filled in the field.

Follow these rules:
- Only use the information present in the text and do not paraphrase.
- If the keys have multiple topics, separate them with a slash (/)
{{ additional_rules }}
"""
```

The next step is to register the updated prompt template, load it back later and format it with any additional rule before rerunning the evaluation.

```python
updated_prompt = mlflow.genai.register_prompt(
    name="ocr-question-answer",
    template=updated_template,
    commit_message="Update commit",
    tags={
        "author": "author@example.com",
        "task": "ocr",
        "language": "en",
    },
)

# Load the updated prompt and format it with additional rules

prompt = mlflow.genai.load_prompt(name_or_uri="ocr-question-answer", version=updated_prompt.version)
system_prompt = prompt.format(additional_rules="Use exact formatting you see in the form.")


results_updated = mlflow.models.evaluate(
    model=batch_completion,
    data=pd.DataFrame({"inputs": images, "truth": jsons}),
    targets="truth",
    model_type="text",
    predictions="predictions",
    extra_metrics=[custom_key_value_accuracy]
)

print("Custom metric results:", results_updated.metrics)
eval_table_updated = results_updated.tables["eval_results_table"]
print("\n Per-row scores:")
print(eval_table_updated[['key_value_accuracy/score']])
```

This updated prompt may lead to a marginal improvement in the metric for each image. However, there are still mismatches in values between the ground truth and the LLM response. As showcased above using Prompt Registry, iteratively refining the prompt can address these issues, leading to better alignment with the expected output.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

By leveraging MLflow GenAI capabilities, we efficiently manage prompts and evaluate models for our OCR tool. With all runs, prompts, and metrics logged, we can compare different models or prompt strategies side-by-side in the MLflow UI. This enables data-driven decisions, justifies model selection, and enables both technical and non-technical contributors to collaborate, iterate, and deploy AI solutions confidently.

We can take several directions to further enhance our workflow and outcomes:

**Expand Your Custom Metrics:** Scale out your custom evaluation metrics to more accurately capture the requirements of our specific OCR problem. This allows us to measure what truly matters for the use case, such as domain-specific accuracy, formatting compliance, or business logic adherence.

**Experiment with Multiple LLMs:** Take advantage of MLflowâ€™s ability to track and compare experiments by iterating with different LLMs. We can view and analyze results side-by-side in the MLflow UI, making it easier to identify which model best fits our needs and to justify model selection with clear, data-driven evidence.

**Utilize Tracing and Model Logging:** Leverage MLflowâ€™s tracing and model logging features to gain end-to-end visibility into our GenAI workflows. By capturing detailed traces and logs, we can iteratively refine our models and prompts, diagnose issues, and ensure reproducibilityâ€”all within the context of our custom metrics.

**Expand Governance and Access Control**: Implement robust governance practices to ensure secure, compliant, and auditable management of our GenAI assets and workflows. This is especially important for scaling in enterprise or regulated environments.

These are just a few of the many ways we can build on this solution. Whether we are aiming to improve model performance, streamline collaboration, or scale our solution to new domains, these MLflow capabilities support us in our GenAI development.
