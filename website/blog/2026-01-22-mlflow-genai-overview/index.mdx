We're excited to introduce the **Agent Dashboard**, a new Overview tab in MLflow GenAI experiments that gives you instant comprehensive visibility into your agent's health.

## Challenges

Building GenAI applications is hard, but keeping them running well in production is harder. Teams often struggle to answer basic questions:

- Why is my application slow today?
- Are my outputs maintaining quality over time?
- Which tools in my agent are causing failures?
- How much am I spending on tokens?

Previously, answering these questions required digging through individual traces or building custom dashboards. The Overview tab changes that.

## One Dashboard, Complete Visibility

The Overview tab automatically aggregates metrics from all traces logged to an experiment. It consolidates these insights into three focused views:

- **Usage**: Track requests, latency, errors, and token consumption over time
- **Quality**: Monitor agent quality based on your [MLflow scorers](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/eval-monitor/scorers/)
- **Tool Calls**: Analyze agent tool performance, success rates, and error patterns

Each view includes time range and granularity controls, making it easy to zoom in on issues or spot long-term trends.

## Get Started

The Overview tab is available since MLflow 3.9.0. Install the latest version:

```bash
# Using uv
uv pip install mlflow>=3.9.0

# Using pip
pip install mlflow>=3.9.0
```

Then enable tracing in your application. For example, with OpenAI autologging:

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.openai.autolog()
```

MLflow will automatically trace all OpenAI calls and populate the dashboard with your metrics. MLflow supports [40+ integrations](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/integrations/) including LangChain, LiteLLM, Claude Code, and more.

For details on each tab and available metrics, check out the [MLflow Tracing UI documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/observe-with-traces/ui/).
