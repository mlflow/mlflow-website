## MLflow Tracing: Observability for GenAI

GenAI providers and frameworks often respond with complicated and hard-to-read data structures or with simple responses that hide intermediate steps. Furthermore, it can be hard to keep track of and compare GenAI model/framework calls over time, especially if you are moving between frameworks and scripts.

[MLflow's LLM tracing](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html) solves these issues by recording all of your GenAI calls, including both individual LLM calls and multi-step agentic workflows, and providing an easy-to-read interface for browsing and comparing them. You can enable this functionality for most GenAI providers with a single line of code: `mlflow.<provider>.autolog()`.

This blog will show how to get started with MLflow tracing—in about five minutes. It assumes some familiarity with GenAI APIs (e.g. the OpenAI API), but does not assume any prior familiarity with MLflow.

## Quickstart

We'll start by showing how to use MLflow autologging to automatically trace calls to OpenAI models, though MLflow supports automatic tracing for an [ever-growing number of providers and frameworks](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html#automatic-tracing) including Anthropic, Ollama, Langchain, LlamaIndex, and may others. To get started, install the MLflow and OpenAI Python packages with:

```shell
pip install mlflow openai
```

### Collecting Traces with Autologging

In a Python script or notebook, import MLflow and the GenAI provider you're working with, and enable tracing with `mlflow.<provider>.autolog`. Here's how to set up automatic tracing for OpenAI:

```python
import mlflow
from openai import OpenAI

mlflow.openai.autolog()
```

Make sure to [create and set your OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?language=python#create-and-export-an-api-key)! You can set it in your environment with

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

Now, when you use the OpenAI library, MLflow will capture _traces_ of your model calls. For example, MLflow will log a trace of the following OpenAI invocation because we have enabled autologging.

```python
client = OpenAI()

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is an MLflow tracking server?"
        }
    ]
)
```

### Viewing your LLM Traces

The MLflow UI provides an AI observability dashboard for viewing your traces. Start the MLflow UI from your terminal with:

```shell
mlflow ui
```

Navigate to the UI. the output of the `mlflow ui` command will tell you where to go (`http://localhost:5000` by default). In the UI, navigate to the "Traces" tab. This will list all of the collected traces. Click on a trace's Trace ID to open up a new pane with more details.

![Traces in the MLflow UI](/img/blog/tracing-intro/01_tracing_ui.gif)

:::tip

By default, the MLflow server will listen on `http://localhost:5000`. You can choose a different port with `mlflow ui -p <port>`. For example, to listen on port 5001, use `mlflow ui -p 5001`.

:::

Starting the MLflow tracking server with `mlflow ui` also enables you to [view traces right in a Jupyter notebook](https://mlflow.org/blog/mlflow-tracing-in-jupyter)! You just have to set the tracking uri to the location specified above:

```python
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")
```

Then, when you invoke an AI model/framework with tracing enabled, the generated trace(s) will appear right in the notebook outputs.

![Tracing in Jupyter Notebooks](/img/blog/tracing-intro/02_jupyter.gif)

You can disable this functionality with `mlflow.tracing.disable_notebook_display()`.

## Organizing your Traces

If you use tracing across multiple different projects and tasks, you might want to organize the traces into separate groups.

The easiest way to organize your traces is to separate them into [_experiments_](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#experiments). Each experiment has its own traces tab, which displays the traces for that experiment.

You can create an experiment in the UI (With the "+" button next to "Experiments"), with the MLflow CLI, or with Python. Let's create a new experiment called "Quickstart" and log a trace.

```python
mlflow.set_experiment("quickstart")

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is an MLflow tracking server?"
        }
    ]
)
```

We can now find this trace in the "Traces" tab in the "quickstart" experiment.

![Trace in Experiment](/img/blog/tracing-intro/03_experiment.png)

The `set_experiment` function specifies which experiment traces should be logged to, creating it if it does not exist, so the code snippet above created a new "quickstart" experiment.

You can also organize your traces with [tags](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracing#trace-tags) and [runs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracing#q-how-can-i-associate-a-trace-with-an-mlflow-run).

## Tracing Other Providers

Our quickstart example focused on OpenAI, but MLflow supports automatic tracing of [many different AI providers and frameworks](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracing#automatic-tracing). The approach is the same: just add the line `mlflow.<provider>.autolog` to your notebook or script.

Here are a few examples. See [here](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracing#automatic-tracing) for the full list of supported providers.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Anthropic" label="Anthropic" default>
  
  Enable automatic tracing for Anthropic model calls with `mlflow.anthropic.autolog()`.
  
  ```python
import anthropic
import mlflow

mlflow.anthropic.autolog()

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

message = client.messages.create(
model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
max_tokens=1000,
temperature=1,
messages=[
{
"role": "user",
"content": "What is an MLflow tracking server?"
}
]
)

````

This returns the following in the MLflow UI:

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="langchain" label="LangChain">

Enable automatic tracing for LangChain and LangGraph with `mlflow.langchain.autolog()`. MLflow automatic tracing captures all LangChain component executions, including chains, LLMs, agents, tools, prompts, and retrievers.

```python
import mlflow

from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

mlflow.set_experiment("quickstart")

mlflow.langchain.autolog()

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=1, max_tokens=500)

prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template(
    "Explain the following MLflow concept at the specified technical level. "
    "For 'beginner', use simple analogies and avoid complex terms. "
    "For 'intermediate', include more technical details and some code examples. "
    "For 'advanced', go deep into implementation details and provide comprehensive explanations. "
    "Technical level: {level}. Question: {question}"
)

chain = prompt_template | llm | StrOutputParser()

chain.invoke(
    {
        "level": "beginner",
        "question": "How do MLflow tracking servers help with experiment management?",
    }
)
````

This example LangChain chain includes multiple components:

- The `PromptTemplate`, which assembles the prompt based on the user input
- The `ChatOpenAI` model, which is used to call the OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini` model
- The `StrOutputParser`, which returns the final answer to the user's query as a string

We can see each of these components in the MLflow UI, nested under the parent `RunnableSequence` chain.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ollama" label="Ollama">

[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) is a tool for running open source AI models locally. You can enable automatic tracing of Ollama models via Ollama's [OpenAI-compatible API](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/openai.md) and MLflow's OpenAI autologging. You just need to set the base URL to your Ollama REST endpoint.

This pattern should work with any provider that offers an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, even those that are not explicitly referenced in the docs.

Here's how it works for Ollama:

1. First, run the Ollama server with your desired model.

```bash
ollama run phi3:latest
```

2. Configure the OpenAI client, setting the `base_url` to the Ollama OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:11434/v1",  # The local Ollama REST endpoint
    api_key="dummy",  # Required to instantiate OpenAI client, it can be a random string
)
```

3. Enable MLflow OpenAI autologging and query the model

```python
mlflow.openai.autolog()

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="phi3:latest",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is an MLflow tracking server?"}
    ]
)
```

Here is the trace of the Ollama model call in the MLflow UI.

## Conclusion: Effective LLM tracing with one line of code

In this guide, you have learned how to use MLflow's autologging capabilities to get a complete AI observability solution with a single line of code. If you are using one of the [many GenAI frameworks/providers](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracing#automatic-tracing) for which MLflow offers automatic tracing—including any providers with OpenAI-compatible endpoints—automatic logging is the easiest way to visualize and debug your AI application behavior. All you need is `mlflow.<provider>.autolog()`.

### Next Steps

Autologging is a great place to start with MLflow tracing, but you may need more flexibility in how you collect and use traces as you develop more complex GenAI applications. Furthermore, MLflow includes many tools for working with GenAI applications beyond tracing.
