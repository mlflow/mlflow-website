**In this blog post, we delve into the integration of AWS Bedrock Agent as a ChatModel within MLflow, focusing on
how to leverage Bedrock's [Action Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-action-create.html)
and [Knowledge Bases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-kb-add.html) to build a
conversational AI application. The blog will guide you through setting up the Bedrock Agent, configuring
Action Groups to enable custom actions with Lambda, and utilizing knowledge bases for context-aware interactions.
A special emphasis is placed on implementing tracing within MLflow.By the end of this article, you'll have a good
understanding of how to combine AWS Bedrock's advanced features with MLflow's capabilities such as agent request
tracing, model tracking and consistent signatures for input examples.**

## What is AWS Bedrock?

Amazon Bedrock is a managed service by AWS that simplifies the development of generative AI applications. It provides access to a variety of foundation models (FMs) from leading AI providers through a single API, enabling developers to build and scale AI solutions securely and efficiently.

Key Components Relevant to This Integration:

**Bedrock Agent**: At a high level, a bedrock agent is an abstraction within bedrock that consists of a foundation model,
action groups and knowledge bases.

**Action Groups**: These are customizable sets of actions that define what tasks the Bedrock Agent can perform.
Action Groups consist of an OpenAPI Schema and the corresponding Lambda functions that will be used to execute tool calls.
The OpenAPI Schema is used to define APIs available for the agent to invoke and complete tasks.

**Knowledge Bases**: Amazon Bedrock supports the creation of Knowledge Bases to implement
Retrieval Augmented Generation workflows. It consists of data sources (on S3 or webpages)
and a vector store that contains the embedded references to this data.

Bedrock's Agent execution process and the corresponding tracing for Agent instrumentation is grouped as follows:

**Pre-processing**
This step validates, contextualizes and categorizes user input.

**Orchestration**
This step handles the interpretation of user inputs, deciding when to and which tasks to perform,
and iteratively refines responses

**Post-processing (Optional)**
This step formats the final response before returning to the user.

**Traces**
Each step above has an execution trace, which consists of rationale, actions, queries and observations at each step
of the agent's response. This includes both the inputs and outputs of action groups and knowledge base queries.

We will look at these traces in detail below.

## What is a ChatModel in MLflow?

The [ChatModel class](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/chat-model-guide/index.html) is specifically
designed to make it easier to implement models that are compatible with
popular large language model (LLM) chat APIs. It enables you to seamlessly bring in your own models or agents and
leverage MLflow's functionality, even if those models aren't natively supported as a flavor in MLflow. Additionally,
It provides default signatures, which are static for ChatModel, unlike PythonModel.

In the following sections, we will use ChatModel to wrap the Bedrock Agent.

For more detailed information about ChatModel, you can read the MLflow documentation
[here](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/chat-model-guide/index.html) and
[here](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#mlflow.pyfunc.ChatModel)

## Setting up AWS Bedrock Agent with an Action group

In this section, we will deploy all components of a bedrock agent so that we can invoke it as a `ChatModel` in MLflow.

### Prerequisites

You will need to setup following items (either via the AWS console or SDKs):

- Setting up role for the agent and Lambda function. [Example](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/python/example_code/bedrock-agent/scenario_get_started_with_agents.py#L148)
- Create/deploy the agent. [Example](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/python/example_code/bedrock-agent/scenario_get_started_with_agents.py#L191)
  - **Important**: Save the agent ID here as we will need this below.
- Creating a Lambda function. [Example](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/python/example_code/bedrock-agent/scenario_get_started_with_agents.py#L218)
- Configuring IAM permissions for agent-Lambda interaction. [Example](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/python/example_code/bedrock-agent/scenario_get_started_with_agents.py#L283) and [Example](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/python/example_code/bedrock-agent/scenario_get_started_with_agents.py#L297)
- Creating an action group to link the agent and Lambda. [Example](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/python/example_code/bedrock-agent/scenario_get_started_with_agents.py#L312)
  - **Important**:Save the agent alias ID here as we will need this below.
- Deploy Bedrock agent with an alias. [Example](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/python/example_code/bedrock-agent/scenario_get_started_with_agents.py#L342)

<b>In our case, we are going to deploy the following example action group, which calculates the next optimal departure
date for a Hohmann transfer from Earth to Mars, based on the spacecraft's mass and specific impulse.</b>

### OpenAPI schema for Action Groups

As described above, here is the OpenAPI Schema for our example action group:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Time API

          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
      responses:
        "200":

          content:
            "application/json":
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:

                    type: string
                    description: Next Mars Launch Window

Here are some important remarks about this `BedrockModel` implementation:

- AWS access key ID, secret key and the session token are externalized here. These need to be present in the environment before we can run inference.
  You will need to generate it for your IAM user and set them as environment variables.

```bash
aws sts get-session-token --duration-seconds 3600
```

And then set the following:

```python
import os

os.environ['AWS_ACCESS_KEY'] = "<AccessKeyId>"
os.environ['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'] = "<SecretAccessKey>"
os.environ['AWS_SESSION_TOKEN'] = "<SessionToken>"

```

As noticed in the code above, these do not get logged with the model and are only set inside `load_context`.
This method is called when ChatModel is constructed. Further details are [here](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel.load_context)

- Bedrock agent ID and agent alias ID are passed via `model_config` that we will use below.

- boto3 module has been excluded from getting pickled. This is done via `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` where we exclude it and reset it respectively

### Log and load the BedrockModel

### Mapping Bedrock Agent Trace Data to MLflow Span Objects

In this step, we need to iterate over the data that is returned within the bedrock agent's response trace
to provide relevant mappings to create the MLflow span object.
AWS Bedrock agent's response is a flat list with trace events connected by `traceId`.
Here is the raw trace sent in the bedrock agent's response:

Each group of events with the same _`traceId`_ will contain at least two events: one of type _`modelInvocationInput`_ and
one of type _`modelInvocationOutput`_. Groups that involve action group traces will also include events of type
_`actionGroupInvocationInput`_ and _`actionGroupInvocationOutput`_. Similarly, groups that use knowledge bases will have
additional events of type _`knowledgeBaseLookupInput`_ and _`knowledgeBaseLookupOutput`_.
In the _`BedrockModel`_ mentioned above, it implements an approach to parse these event groups into trace nodes.
This method allows the trace to display the reasoning behind selecting action groups/knowledge bases to answer queries and invoking
the corresponding Lambda function calls, as defined in our example OpenAPI spec above.
This structure helps to clearly show the flow of information and decision-making process that bedrock agent follows.

### Visualizing Trace Breakdown in the MLflow UI

1. <b>Initial Prompt Submitted to the Bedrock Agent.</b>
   ![Thumbnail](bedrock_input_prompt.png)

2. <b>In this trace, we can observe how the Bedrock Agent evaluates and selects the most suitable Action Group for the task at hand.</b>
   ![Thumbnail](action_group_decision.png)

3. <b>Once an Action Group is selected, its invocation is traced, displaying the input and output interactions with the underlying Lambda function as outlined by the OpenAPI Spec above.</b>
   ![Thumbnail](invoking_action_group.png)

4. <b>Furthermore, Bedrock's supplementary trace is included under the Attributes section,
   along with additional metadata as shown below</b>
   ![Thumbnail](traces_attributes.png)

5. <b>Subsequently, the final response from the agent is traced, as depicted below.</b>
   ![Thumbnail](retrieved_response.png)

**Note**: We cannot break down the span's duration into individual trace durations
because the Bedrock Agent's trace response does not include timestamps for each trace step.

## Conclusion

In this blog, we explored how to integrate the AWS Bedrock Agent as an MLflow ChatModel, focusing on Action Groups,
Knowledge Bases, and Tracing. We demonstrated how to easily build a custom ChatModel using MLflow's flexible and
powerful APIs. This approach enables you to leverage MLflow's tracing and logging capabilities, even for models or
flavors that are not natively supported by MLflow.

Key Takeaways from This Blog:

- Deploying a Bedrock Agent with Action Groups as AWS Lambda Functions:
  - We covered how to set up a Bedrock Agent and implement custom actions using AWS Lambda functions within Action Groups.
- Mapping the AWS Bedrock Agent's Custom Tracing to MLflow span/trace objects:
  - We demonstrated how to convert the agent's custom tracing data into MLflow span objects for better observability.
- Logging and Loading the Bedrock Agent as an MLflow ChatModel:
  - We showed how to log the Bedrock Agent into MLflow as a _`ChatModel`_ and how to load it for future use.
- Externalizing AWS Client and Bedrock Configurations:
  - We explained how to externalize AWS client and Bedrock configurations to safeguard secrets and make it easy to adjust model settings without the need to re-log the model.
