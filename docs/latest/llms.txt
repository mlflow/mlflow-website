- [RAG Evaluation with Built-in Judges](/mlflow-website/docs/latest/genai/eval-monitor/scorers/llm-judge/rag.md): Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems combine retrieval and generation to provide contextually relevant responses. Evaluating RAG applications requires assessing both the retrieval quality (are the right documents retrieved?) and the generation quality (is the response grounded in those documents?).
- [RetrievalSufficiency judge](/mlflow-website/docs/latest/genai/eval-monitor/scorers/llm-judge/rag/context-sufficiency.md): The RetrievalSufficiency judge evaluates whether the retrieved context (from RAG applications, agents, or any system that retrieves documents) contains enough information to adequately answer the user's request based on the ground truth label provided as expectedfacts or an expectedresponse.
- [RetrievalGroundedness judge](/mlflow-website/docs/latest/genai/eval-monitor/scorers/llm-judge/rag/groundedness.md): The RetrievalGroundedness judge assesses whether your application's response is factually supported by the provided context (either from a RAG system or generated by a tool call), helping detect hallucinations or statements not backed by that context.
- [Answer and Context Relevance Judges](/mlflow-website/docs/latest/genai/eval-monitor/scorers/llm-judge/rag/relevance.md): MLflow provides two built-in LLM judges to assess relevance in your GenAI applications.

- [Tool Call Evaluation with Built-in Judges](/mlflow-website/docs/latest/genai/eval-monitor/scorers/llm-judge/tool-call.md): AI agents often use tools (functions) to complete tasks - from fetching data to performing calculations. Evaluating tool-calling applications requires assessing whether agents select appropriate tools and provide correct arguments to fulfill user requests.
- [ToolCallCorrectness Judge](/mlflow-website/docs/latest/genai/eval-monitor/scorers/llm-judge/tool-call/correctness.md): The ToolCallCorrectness judge evaluates whether the tools called by an agent and the arguments they are called with are correct given the user request.
