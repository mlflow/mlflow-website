For example,\\n[mlflow.sklearn.log_model](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.sklearn.html#mlflow.sklearn.log_model)\\nwill log a scikit-learn model as an MLflow artifact without requiring you to define custom methods for\\nprediction or for handling artifacts.\\n\\nIn some cases, however, you might be working in a framework for which MLflow does not have\\nbuilt-in methods, or you might want something different than the model\u2019s default prediction\\noutputs. In those cases, MLflow allows you to create custom models to work with essentially\\nany framework and to integrate custom logic to existing supported frameworks.\\n\\nIn its simplest form, all that\u2019s required is to define a custom predict method and log the model.\\nThe following example defines a simple pyfunc model that just returns the square of its input:\\n\\n```python\\nimport mlflow\\n\\n# Define a custom model\\nclass MyModel(mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel):\\n    def predict(self, context, model_input):\\n        # Directly return the square of the input\\n        return model_input**2\\n\\n\\n# Save the model\\nwith mlflow.start_run():\\n    model_info = mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(\\n        artifact_path=\\"model\\",\\n        python_model=MyModel()\\n    )\\n\\n# Load the model\\nloaded_model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(\\n    model_uri=model_info.model_uri\\n)\\n\\n# Predict\\nloaded_model.predict(2)\\n```\\n\\nLet\u2019s dig into how this works, starting with some basic concepts.\\n\\n## Models and Model Flavors\\n\\n![Models and Flavors](models-and-flavors.png)\\n\\nAn MLflow model is a directory that includes everything needed to reproduce a machine learning model\\nacross different environments. Aside from the stored model itself, the most important component\\nstored is an `MLmodel` YAML file that specifies the model\u2019s supported model flavors.\\nA [model flavor](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/traditional-ml/creating-custom-pyfunc/part1-named-flavors.html#components-of-a-model-in-mlflow)\\nis a set of rules specifying how MLflow can interact with the model (i.e., save it, load it, and\\nget predictions from it).\\n\\nWhen you create a custom model in MLflow, it has the `python_function` or pyfunc model flavor,\\nwhich is a kind of \u201cuniversal translator\u201d across formats in MLflow. When you save a model in MLflow\\nusing a built-in model flavor, e.g. with [mlflow.sklearn.log_model](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.sklearn.html#mlflow.sklearn.log_model),\\nthat model also has the pyfunc model flavor in addition to its framework-specific flavor.\\nHaving both framework-specific and pyfunc model flavors allows you to use the model via the\\nframework\u2019s native API (e.g., `scikit-learn`) or via the pyfunc flavor\u2019s framework-agnostic inference API.\\n\\nModels with the pyfunc flavor are loaded as instances of the [mlflow.pyfunc.PyfuncModel](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html?highlight=pyfunc#mlflow.pyfunc.PyFuncModel)\\nclass, which exposes a standardized predict method. This enables straightforward inference through a single\\nfunction call, regardless of the underlying model\'s implementation details.\\n\\n## Defining Custom MLflow Pyfunc Models\\n\\nSaving a model from any supported machine learning framework as an MLflow model results in the\\ncreation of a pyfunc model flavor that provides a framework-agnostic interface for managing and\\nusing the model. But what if you\u2019re using a framework without an MLflow integration, or you\u2019re\\ntrying to elicit some custom behavior from a model? [Custom pyfunc models](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#creating-custom-pyfunc-models)\\nallow you to work with essentially any framework and to integrate custom logic.\\n\\nTo implement a custom pyfunc model, define a new Python class inheriting from the PythonModel class\\nand implement the necessary methods. Minimally, this will involve implementing a custom predict\\nmethod. Next, create an instance of your model and log or save the model. Once you\u2019ve loaded the\\nsaved or logged model, you can use it for predictions.\\n\\n![Creating a custom model](custom-model-creation.png)\\n\\nLet\u2019s work through a few examples, each adding a little more complexity and highlighting different\\naspects of defining a custom pyfunc model. We\u2019ll cover four main techniques for implementing custom\\nbehaviors in pyfunc models:\\n\\n1. Implementing a custom `predict` method\\n2. Implementing a custom `__init__` method\\n3. Implementing a custom `load_context` method\\n4. Implementing user-defined custom methods\\n\\n![Pyfunc model customization](custom-pyfunc-types.png)\\n\\n### Defining a custom `predict` method\\n\\nAt a minimum, a pyfunc model should specify a custom predict method that defines what happens when\\nwe call `model.predict`. Here\u2019s an example of a custom model that applies a simple linear\\ntransformation to the model inputs, multiplying each input by two and adding three:\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport mlflow\\nfrom mlflow.pyfunc import PythonModel\\n\\n\\n# Custom PythonModel class\\nclass SimpleLinearModel(PythonModel):\\n    def predict(self, context, model_input):\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        Applies a simple linear transformation\\n        to the input data. For example, y = 2x + 3.\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        # Assuming model_input is a pandas DataFrame with one column\\n        return pd.DataFrame(2 * model_input + 3)\\n\\n\\nwith mlflow.start_run():\\n    model_info = mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(\\n        artifact_path=\\"linear_model\\",\\n        python_model=SimpleLinearModel(),\\n        input_example=pd.DataFrame([10, 20, 30]),\\n    )\\n```\\n\\nNote that you can (and should) also include a [signature](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#model-signature)\\nand an [input example](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#model-input-example) when saving/logging a\\nmodel. If you pass an input example, the signature will be inferred automatically. The model\\nsignature provides a way for MLflow to enforce correct usage of your model.\\n\\nOnce we\u2019ve defined the model path and saved an instance of the model, we can load the saved model\\nand use it to generate predictions:\\n\\n```python\\n# Now the model can be loaded and used for predictions\\nloaded_model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(model_uri=model_info.model_uri)\\nmodel_input = pd.DataFrame([1, 2, 3])  # Example input data\\nprint(loaded_model.predict(model_input))  # Outputs transformed data\\n```\\n\\nWhich will return:\\n\\n```text\\n:    0\\n: 0  5\\n: 1  7\\n: 2  9\\n```\\n\\nNote that if a custom `predict` method is all you need\u2014that is, if your model does not have any\\nartifacts that require special handling\u2014you can save or log the `predict` method directly without\\nneeding to wrap it in a Python class:\\n\\n```python\\nimport mlflow\\nimport pandas as pd\\n\\n\\ndef predict(model_input):\\n    \\"\\"\\"\\n    Applies a simple linear transformation\\n    to the input data. For example, y = 2x + 3.\\n    \\"\\"\\"\\n    # Assuming model_input is a pandas DataFrame with one column\\n    return pd.DataFrame(2 * model_input + 3)\\n\\n\\n# Pass predict method as python_model argument to save/log model\\nwith mlflow.start_run():\\n    model_info = mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(\\n        artifact_path=\\"simple_function\\",\\n        python_model=predict,\\n        input_example=pd.DataFrame([10, 20, 30]),\\n    )\\n```\\n\\nNote that with this approach, we **must include** an input example along with the custom predict\\nmethod. We also have to modify the predict method such that it takes only one input (i.e., no self or context).\\nRunning this example and then loading with the same code as the preceding code block will retain the same output as\\nthe example using a class definiton.\\n\\n### Parameterizing the custom model\\n\\nNow suppose we want to parameterize the custom linear function model so that it can be used with\\ndifferent slopes and intercepts. We can define the `__init__` method to set up custom parameters,\\nas in the following example. Note that the custom model class\u2019s `__init__` method should not be used\\nto load external resources like data files or pretrained models; these are handled in the\\n`load_context` method, which we\u2019ll discuss shortly.\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport mlflow\\nfrom mlflow.pyfunc import PythonModel\\n\\n\\n# Custom PythonModel class\\nclass ParameterizedLinearModel(PythonModel):\\n    def __init__(self, slope, intercept):\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        Initialize the parameters of the model. Note that we are not loading\\n        any external resources here, just setting up the parameters.\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        self.slope = slope\\n        self.intercept = intercept\\n\\n    def predict(self, context, model_input):\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        Applies a simple linear transformation\\n        to the input data. For example, y = 2x + 3.\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        # Assuming model_input is a pandas DataFrame with one column\\n        return pd.DataFrame(self.slope * model_input + self.intercept)\\n\\n\\nlinear_model = ParameterizedLinearModel(10, 20)\\n\\n# Saving the model with mlflow\\nwith mlflow.start_run():\\n    model_info = mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(\\n        artifact_path=\\"parameter_model\\",\\n        python_model=linear_model,\\n        input_example=pd.DataFrame([10, 20, 30]),\\n    )\\n```\\n\\nAgain, we can load this model and make some predictions:\\n\\n```python\\nloaded_model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(model_uri=model_info.model_uri)\\nmodel_input = pd.DataFrame([1, 2, 3])  # Example input data\\nprint(loaded_model.predict(model_input))  # Outputs transformed data\\n```\\n\\n```text\\n:     0\\n: 0  30\\n: 1  40\\n: 2  50\\n```\\n\\nThere are many cases where we might want to parameterize a model in this manner. We can define\\nvariables in the `__init__` method to:\\n\\n- Set model hyperparameters.\\n- A/B test models with different parameter sets.\\n- Set user-specific customizations.\\n- Toggle features.\\n- Set, e.g., access credentials and endpoints for models that access external APIs.\\n\\nIn some cases, we may want to be able to pass parameters at inference time rather than when we\\ninitialize the model. This can be accomplished with\\n[model inference params](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#model-inference-params). To use\\ninference params, we must pass a valid model signature including `params`. Here\u2019s how to adapt the\\npreceding example to use inference params:\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport mlflow\\nfrom mlflow.models import infer_signature\\nfrom mlflow.pyfunc import PythonModel\\n\\n\\n# Custom PythonModel class\\nclass LinearFunctionInferenceParams(PythonModel):\\n    def predict(self, context, model_input, params):\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        Applies a simple linear transformation\\n        to the input data. For example, y = 2x + 3.\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        slope = params[\\"slope\\"]\\n        # Assuming model_input is a pandas DataFrame with one column\\n        return pd.DataFrame(slope * model_input + params[\\"intercept\\"])\\n\\n\\n# Set default params\\nparams = {\\"slope\\": 2, \\"intercept\\": 3}\\n\\n# Define model signature\\nsignature = infer_signature(model_input=pd.DataFrame([10, 20, 30]), params=params)\\n\\n# Save the model with mlflow\\nwith mlflow.start_run():\\n    model_info = mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(\\n        artifact_path=\\"model_with_params\\",\\n        python_model=LinearFunctionInferenceParams(),\\n        signature=signature,\\n    )\\n```\\n\\nAfter loading the model as before, you can now pass a `params` argument to the `predict` method,\\nenabling you to use the same loaded model for different combinations of parameters:\\n\\n```python\\nloaded_model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(model_uri=model_info.model_uri)\\n\\nparameterized_predictions = loaded_model.predict(\\n    pd.DataFrame([10, 20, 30]), params={\\"slope\\": 2, \\"intercept\\": 10}\\n)\\nprint(parameterized_predictions)\\n```\\n\\n```text\\n:     0\\n: 0  30\\n: 1  50\\n: 2  70\\n```\\n\\n### Loading external resources with `load_context`\\n\\nCustom models often require external files such as model weights in order to perform inference.\\nThese files, or artifacts, must be handled carefully to avoid unnecessarily loading files into\\nmemory or errors during model serialization. When building custom pyfunc models in MLflow, you can\\nuse the `load_context` method to handle model artifacts correctly.\\n\\nThe `load_context` method receives a `context` object containing artifacts the model can use during\\ninference. You can specify these artifacts using the `artifacts` argument when saving or logging\\nmodels, making them accessible to the `load_context` method via the `context.artifacts` dictionary.\\n\\nIn practice, the `load_context` method often initializes the model called by the `predict` method by\\nhandling the loading of model artifacts.\\n\\nThis raises an important question: why do we load artifacts and define the model in the `load_context`\\nmethod and not in `__init__` or directly in `predict`? Correct usage of `load_context` is essential\\nfor the maintainability, efficiency, scalability, and portability of MLflow pyfunc models. This is because:\\n\\n- The `load_context` method is executed once when the model is loaded via `mlflow.pyfunc.load_model`.\\n  This setup ensures that resource-intensive processes defined within this method, such as loading\\n  large model files, are not repeated unnecessarily. If artifact loading is done in the predict\\n  method, it will occur every single time a prediction is made. This is highly inefficient for\\n  resource-intensive models.\\n- Saving or logging an MLflow `pyfunc` model involves serializing the Python model class (the subclass\\n  of [mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel)\\n  you created) and its attributes. Complex ML models are not always compatible with the methods used\\n  to serialize the Python object, which can lead to errors if they are created as attributes of the Python object.\\n\\nAs an example, suppose we want to load a large language model (LLM) in the `gguf` model format\\n(a file format designed for storing models for inference) and run it with the\\n[ctransformers library](https://pypi.org/project/ctransformers). At the time of writing, there is\\nno built-in model flavor that lets us use `gguf` models for inference, so we\u2019ll create a custom\\npyfunc model that loads the required libraries and model files in the `load_context` method.\\nSpecifically, we\u2019re going to load a quantized version of the [AWQ version of the Mistral 7B model](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-v0.1-AWQ).\\n\\nFirst, we\u2019ll download the model snapshot using the huggingface hub cli:\\n\\n```bash\\nhuggingface-cli download TheBloke/Mistral-7B-v0.1-GGUF \\\\\\n                mistral-7b-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf \\\\\\n                --local-dir /path/to/mistralfiles/ \\\\\\n                --local-dir-use-symlinks False\\n```\\n\\nAnd then we\u2019ll define our custom `pyfunc` model. Note the addition of the `load_context` method:\\n\\n```python\\nimport ctransformers\\nfrom mlflow.pyfunc import PythonModel\\n\\n\\nclass CTransformersModel(PythonModel):\\n    def __init__(self, gpu_layers):\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        Initialize with GPU layer configuration.\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        self.gpu_layers = gpu_layers\\n        self.model = None\\n\\n    def load_context(self, context):\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        Load the model from the specified artifacts directory.\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        model_file_path = context.artifacts[\\"model_file\\"]\\n\\n        # Load the model\\n        self.model = ctransformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\\n            model_path_or_repo_id=model_file_path,\\n            gpu_layers=self.gpu_layers,\\n        )\\n\\n    def predict(self, context, model_input):\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        Perform prediction using the loaded model.\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        if self.model is None:\\n            raise ValueError(\\n                \\"The model has not been loaded. \\"\\n                \\"Ensure that \'load_context\' is properly executed.\\"\\n            )\\n        return self.model(model_input)\\n```\\n\\nThere\u2019s a lot going on here, so let\u2019s break it down. Here are the key points:\\n\\n- As before, we use the `__init__` method to parameterize the model (in this case, to set the\\n  `gpu_layers` argument for the model).\\n- The purpose of the `load_context` method is to load the artifacts required for use in the\\n  `predict` method. In this case, we need to load the model and its weights.\\n- You\u2019ll notice that we reference `context.artifacts[\\"model_file\\"]`. This comes from the artifacts\\n  argument to `mlflow.pyfunc.save_model` or `mlflow.pyfunc.load_model`, as shown in the following\\n  code snippet. This is an important part of working with `pyfunc` models. The `predict` and\\n  `load_context` methods can access the artifacts defined in the artifacts argument to the\\n  `save_model` or `log_model` method via the `context.artifacts` object. `load_context` is executed\\n  when the model is loaded via `load_model`; as described earlier, this provides a way to ensure that\\n  the potentially time-consuming initialization of a model does not occur each time the model is used\\n  for prediction.\\n\\nNow we can initialize and save an instance of the model. Note the artifacts argument to the\\n`save_model` function:\\n\\n```python\\n# Create an instance of the model\\nmistral_model = CTransformersModel(gpu_layers=50)\\n\\n# Log the model using mlflow with the model file as an artifact\\nwith mlflow.start_run():\\n    model_info = mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(\\n        artifact_path=\\"mistral_model\\",\\n        python_model=mistral_model,\\n        artifacts={\\"model_file\\": model_file_path},\\n        pip_requirements=[\\n            \\"ctransformers==0.2.27\\",\\n        ],\\n    )\\n\\n# Load the saved model\\nloaded_model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(model_info.model_uri)\\n\\n# Make a prediction with the model\\nloaded_model.predict(\\"Question: What is the MLflow Pyfunc model flavor?\\")\\n```\\n\\nTo recap: correct use of the `load_context` method helps to ensure efficient handling of model\\nartifacts and prevents errors in serialization that could result from attempting to define artifacts\\nas model attributes.\\n\\n### Defining custom methods\\n\\nYou can define your own methods in the custom `pyfunc` model to handle tasks like preprocessing\\ninputs or post-processing outputs. These custom methods can then be called by the predict method.\\nKeep in mind that these custom methods, just like `__init__` and `predict`, should **not be used** for\\nloading artifacts. Loading artifacts is the exclusive role of the `load_context` method.\\n\\nFor example, we can modify the `CTransformersModel` to incorporate some prompt formatting as follows:\\n\\n```python\\nimport ctransformers\\nfrom mlflow.pyfunc import PythonModel\\n\\n\\nclass CTransformersModel(PythonModel):\\n    def __init__(self, gpu_layers):\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        Initialize with GPU layer configuration.\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        self.gpu_layers = gpu_layers\\n        self.model = None\\n\\n    def load_context(self, context):\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        Load the model from the specified artifacts directory.\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        model_file_path = context.artifacts[\\"model_file\\"]\\n\\n        # Load the model\\n        self.model = ctransformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\\n            model_path_or_repo_id=model_file_path,\\n            gpu_layers=self.gpu_layers,\\n        )\\n\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def _format_prompt(prompt):\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        Formats the user\'s prompt\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        formatted_prompt = (\\n            \\"Question: What is an MLflow Model?\\\\n\\\\n\\"\\n            \\"Answer: An MLflow Model is a directory that includes \\"\\n            \\"everything that is needed to reproduce a machine \\"\\n            \\"learning model across different environments. \\"\\n            \\"It is essentially a container holding the trained model \\"\\n            \\"files, dependencies, environment details, input examples, \\"\\n            \\"and additional metadata. The directory also includes an \\"\\n            \\"MLmodel YAML file, which describes the different \\"\\n            f\\"flavors of the model.\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: {prompt}\\\\nAnswer: \\"\\n        )\\n\\n        return formatted_prompt\\n\\n    def predict(self, context, model_input):\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        Perform prediction using the loaded model.\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        if self.model is None:\\n            raise ValueError(\\n                \\"Model was not loaded. Ensure that \'load_context\' \\"\\n                \\"is properly executed.\\"\\n            )\\n        return self.model(self._format_prompt(model_input))\\n```\\n\\nNow the `predict` method can access the private `_format_prompt` static method to apply custom formatting to the prompts.\\n\\n### Dependencies and Source Code\\n\\nThe custom `CTransformersModel` defined above uses the `ctransformers` library. There are a few\\ndifferent approaches for making sure this library (and any other source code, including from your\\nlocal device) is correctly loaded with your model. Correctly specifying dependencies is essential\\nfor ensuring that custom models work as expected across environments.\\n\\nThere are three main approaches to be aware of for specifying dependencies:\\n\\n- Define pip requirements explicitly with the `pip_requirements` argument to `save_model` or `log_model`.\\n- Add extra pip requirements to an automatically generated set of requirements with the\\n  `extra_pip_requirements` argument to `save_model` or `log_model`.\\n- Define a Conda environment with the `conda_env` argument to `save_model` or `log_model`.\\n\\nEarlier, we used the first approach to specify that the `ctransformers` library was needed:\\n\\n```python\\n# Log the model using mlflow with the model file as an artifact\\nwith mlflow.start_run():\\n    model_info = mlflow.pyfunc.save_model(\\n        artifact_path=\\"mistralmodel\\",\\n        python_model=mistral_model,\\n        artifacts={\\"model_file\\": \\"path/to/mistral/model/on/local/filesystem\\"},\\n        pip_requirements=[\\n            \\"ctransformers==0.2.27\\",\\n        ],\\n    )\\n```\\n\\nIf you do not specify dependencies explicitly, MLflow will attempt to infer the correct set of\\nrequirements and environment details. To enable greater accuracy, it is **strongly recommended** to\\ninclude an `input_example` when saving or logging your model due to the internal execution of a\\nsample inference step that will capture any loaded library references associated with the inference\\nexecution, enabling a higher probability that the correct dependencies will be recorded.\\n\\nYou can also work with custom code on your own filesystem with the `code_path` argument.\\n`code_path` takes a list of paths to Python file dependencies and prepends them to the system\\npath before the model is loaded, so the custom pyfunc model can import from these modules.\\n\\nSee the documentation for the [log_model](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html?highlight=pyfunc#mlflow.pyfunc.log_model) and\\n[save_model](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html?highlight=pyfunc#mlflow.pyfunc.save_model)\\nfunctions for more details on the accepted formats for `pip`, `Conda`, and local code requirements.\\n\\n### Summary: Custom Pyfunc Models in MLflow\\n\\nMLflow has built-in methods for working with models from many popular machine learning frameworks,\\nsuch as [scikit-learn](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#scikit-learn-sklearn),\\n[PyTorch](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#pytorch-pytorch), and\\n[Transformers](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/transformers/index.html). You can define your own custom\\n`mlflow.pyfunc` model when you want to work with models that do not yet have built-in model\\nflavors, or when you want to implement a custom predict method for models with built-in model flavors.\\n\\nThere are several ways to customize `pyfunc` models to get the desired behavior. Minimally, you can\\nimplement a custom `predict` method. If your model requires saving or loading artifacts, you should also\\nimplement a `load_context` method. For further customization, you can use the `__init__` method for\\nsetting custom attributes and define your own custom methods for pre- and post-processing.\\nCombining these approaches gives you the ability to flexibly define custom logic for your machine\\nlearning models.\\n\\n### Further Learning\\n\\nInterested in learning more about custom `pyfunc` implementations?

Carefully tracking metrics, parameters, and artifacts can be challenging when working with complex machine learning libraries or when experimenting with multiple different frameworks with varying APIs and selections of different objects and values to track.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nMLflow\u2019s **automatic logging functionality** offers a simple solution that is compatible with many widely-used machine learning libraries, such as [PyTorch](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pytorch.html), [Scikit-learn](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.sklearn.html#mlflow.sklearn.autolog), and [XGBoost](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.xgboost.html#mlflow.xgboost.autolog). Using `mlflow.autolog()` instructs MLflow to capture essential data without requiring the user to specify what to capture manually. It is an accessible and powerful entrypoint for MLflow\u2019s logging capabilities.\\n\\nTo enable automatic logging, simply add the following line to your machine learning scripts/notebooks, before initiating activities like model training or evaluation that may include information or artifacts you would like to log:\\n\\n```python\\nimport mlflow\\n\\n\\nmlflow.autolog()\\n```\\n\\n## Autolog features\\n\\nWhen a data science workflow includes `mlflow.autolog()`, MLflow will automatically log:\\n\\n- **Metrics**: standard training and evaluation measures such as accuracy and F1 score;\\n- **Parameters**: hyperparameters, such as learning rate and number of estimators; and\\n- **Artifacts**: important files, such as trained models.\\n\\nMLflow\u2019s automatic logging captures details tailored to the specific activities of the library being used: different libraries will result in different logged objects and data. In addition, MLflow logs key metadata such as software versions, a git commit hash, and the file name from which the run was initiated. By documenting the system\'s state during model training, MLflow aims to facilitate environment reproducibility and provide audit lineage, minimizing the possibility of inference issues that could arise from package regressions or deprecations in newer library versions.\\n\\nThe specifics of what is captured through automatic logging depend on the libraries used. Additionally, MLflow captures contextual metadata such as software versions, git commit hash, and the name of the file from which the run was launched. By logging as much detail as possible about the state of the system that trained the model, MLflow can offer environment reproducibility and audit lineage, minimizing the possibility of inference issues resulting from, for example, package regressions or deprecations.\\n\\n## Basic Usage of `mlflow.autolog`\\n\\nYou can access auto logging functionality in two different ways:\\n\\n1. Via the `mlflow.autolog()` function, which enables and configures automatic logging across all supported libraries. This provides a broad, one-size-fits-all approach when working with multiple libraries and is ideal for prototyping and exploratory analysis of a machine learning pipeline.\\n2. Via the library-specific autolog functions, such as `mlflow.sklearn.autolog()`, which enable finer-grained logging configuration for individual libraries. For example, `mlflow.pytorch.autolog()` includes the `log_every_n_epoch` and `log_every_n_step` arguments for specifying how often to log metrics.\\n\\nRegardless of which of these two approaches you use, you do not need to manually initialize an MLflow run with [start_run()](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.start_run) in order to have a run created and for your model, parameters, and metrics to be captured in MLflow.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\n```python\\nimport mlflow\\nfrom sklearn import datasets\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\\n\\n# Generate a 3-class classification problem\\nX, y = datasets.make_classification(\\n    n_samples=1000,\\n    class_sep=0.5,\\n    random_state=42,\\n    n_classes=3,\\n    n_informative=3,\\n)\\n\\n# Split the data into training and validation sets\\nX_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\\n\\n# Enable autolog\\nmlflow.autolog()  # or mlflow.sklearn.autolog()\\n\\n# Initialize the classifier with n_estimators=200 and max_depth=10\\nclf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=200, max_depth=10)\\n\\n# Fit the classifier to the data.\\n# The `fit` method is patched to perform autologging. When engaged in training, a\\n# run is created and the parameters are logged.\\n# After the fit is complete, the model artifact is logged to the run.\\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\\n\\n# Score the model on the data\\n# The current active run is retrieved during calling `score` and the loss metrics are logged\\n# to the active MLflow run.\\nclf.score(X_val, y_val)\\n\\n# Visualize the automatically logged run results to validate what we recorded\\nmlflow.last_active_run()\\n```\\n\\nThe above logs model parameters, metrics, and the model to an MLflow run. The output result of the final statement ([mlflow.last_active_run()](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.last_active_run)) in the above example, which will return data from the run on model metrics, parameters, and logged artifacts (results truncated) is as shown below:\\n\\n```text\\n<Run: data=<RunData:\\nmetrics={\'RandomForestClassifier_score_X_val\': 0.72,\\n         \'training_accuracy_score\': 0.99625,\\n         \'training_f1_score\': 0.9962547564333545,\\n         \'training_log_loss\': 0.3354604497935824,\\n         \'training_precision_score\': 0.9962921348314606,\\n         \'training_recall_score\': 0.99625,\\n         \'training_roc_auc\': 0.9998943433719795,\\n         \'training_score\': 0.99625\\n         },\\n params={\'bootstrap\': \'True\',\\n         \'ccp_alpha\': \'0.0\',\\n         \'class_weight\': \'None\',\\n         \'criterion\': \'gini\',\\n         \'max_depth\': \'10\',\\n         \'max_features\': \'sqrt\',\\n         \'max_leaf_nodes\': \'None\',\\n         [...],\\n         },\\ntags={\'estimator_class\': \'sklearn.ensemble._forest.RandomForestClassifier\',\\n      \'estimator_name\': \'RandomForestClassifier\',\\n      \'mlflow.autologging\': \'sklearn\',\\n      [...]\\n}, [...]>>\\n```\\n\\nYou can also access these in the mlflow ui by executing [mlflow ui](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#tracking-ui) on a command line terminal.\\n\\n![The MLflow Tracking UI](./autolog_in_ui.png)\\n\\nThe MLflow UI also allows you to graphically compare different metrics and parameters across multiple runs, including those generated via `mlflow.autolog`.\\n\\n![Run comparison of autologged runs in the MLflow UI](./autolog_compare_runs.png)\\n\\n## Configuration and Customization\\n\\nThe automatic logging functions take many arguments that give the user greater control over logging behavior. For example, `mlflow.autolog()` includes `log_models` and `log_datasets` arguments (both `True` by default) that specify whether models and dataset information should be saved to the MLflow run, enabling you to specify what is actually logged. To disable automatic logging of datasets while continuing to log all the usual elements, simply disable the autologging of datasets feature by setting `mlflow.autolog(log_datasets=False)` before fitting a model. You can also adjust the behavior of library-specific autolog functions: for example, the `mlflow.sklearn.autolog()` function includes a `max_tuning_runs` argument that specifies how many nested runs to capture when performing hyperparameter searches.\\n\\n`mlflow.autolog()` can be used in combination with the library-specific autolog functions to control the logging behavior for specific libraries. The library-specific autolog call will always supersede `mlflow.autolog()`, regardless of the order in which they are called. For example, combining `mlflow.autolog()` with `mlflow.sklearn.autolog(disable=True)` will result in automatic logging for all supported libraries except for `scikit-learn`.\\n\\nIt is important to consult the documentation for the specific framework(s) you are using in order to understand what is logged automatically and what configuration options are available. See the [further reading section below](#further-reading) for links.\\n\\n## Conclusion and Next Steps\\n\\nMLflow\'s autologging capabilities and library-specific automatic logging functions provide a straightforward starting point for MLflow tracking with little or no required configuration. They log key metrics, parameters, and artifacts from many popular machine learning libraries, allowing users to track their machine learning workflows without writing custom tracking code.\\n\\nThey are not, however, the right solution for all use cases. If you only need to track a handful of specific metrics, enabling automatic logging may be inefficient, resulting in much more generated data and stored artifacts than needed. Furthermore, automatic logging is not available for every possible framework and custom values one might want to track. In such cases, it might be necessary to [manually specify what to track](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking/tracking-api.html#logging-functions).\\n\\n## Further Reading\\n\\n- [MLflow Documentation on Automatic Logging](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking/autolog.html)\\n- [Python API reference for mlflow.autolog](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.autolog)\\n- Python API references for library-specific autolog functions\\n  - [PyTorch](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pytorch.html)\\n  - [Tensorflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.tensorflow.html#mlflow.tensorflow.autolog)\\n  - [Scikit-learn](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.sklearn.html#mlflow.sklearn.autolog)\\n  - [XGBoost](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.xgboost.html#mlflow.xgboost.autolog)\\n  - [PySpark](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyspark.ml.html#mlflow.pyspark.ml.autolog)\\n  - [Statsmodels](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.statsmodels.html#mlflow.statsmodels.autolog)\\n  - [LightGBM](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.lightgbm.html#mlflow.lightgbm.autolog)\\n  - [Paddle](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.paddle.html#mlflow.paddle.autolog)\\n  - [Fastai](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.fastai.html#mlflow.fastai.autolog)"},{"id":"mlflow-docs-overhaul","metadata":{"permalink":"/mlflow-website/blog/mlflow-docs-overhaul","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-31-mlflow-docs-overhaul.md","title":"MLflow Docs Overhaul","description":"The MLflow Documentation is getting an upgrade.","date":"2023-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 31, 2023","tags":[{"label":"docs","permalink":"/mlflow-website/blog/tags/docs"}],"readingTime":5.11,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"MLflow maintainers","title":"MLflow maintainers","url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow.git","imageURL":"https://github.com/mlflow-automation.png","key":"mlflow-maintainers"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"MLflow Docs Overhaul","tags":["docs"],"slug":"mlflow-docs-overhaul","authors":["mlflow-maintainers"],"thumbnail":"img/blog/docs-overhaul.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Automatic Metric, Parameter, and Artifact Logging with mlflow.autolog","permalink":"/mlflow-website/blog/mlflow-autolog"}},"content":"The MLflow Documentation is getting an upgrade.\\n\\n## Overhauling the MLflow Docs\\n\\nWe\'re thrilled to announce a comprehensive overhaul of the MLflow Docs. This initiative is not just about refreshing the look and feel but about reimagining how our users interact with our content. Our primary goal is to enhance clarity, improve navigation, and provide more in-depth resources for our community.\\n\\n## A Renewed Focus on User Experience\\n\\nThe MLflow documentation has always been an essential resource for our users. Over time, we\'ve received invaluable feedback, and we\'ve listened. The modernization effort is a direct response to the needs and preferences of our community.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nAlong with working on covering new cutting-edge features as part of this documentation overhaul, we\'re working on addressing the complexity of getting started. As the first part of a series of tutorials and guides focusing on the initial learning phase, we\'ve created a new [getting started guide](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/getting-started/logging-first-model/index.html), the first of many in a new series we\'re working on in an effort to teach the fundamentals of using MLflow. We feel that more in-depth instructional tutorials for learning the concepts and tools of MLflow will help to enhance the user experience for not only new users, but experienced users who need a refresher of how to do certain tasks.\\n\\nThere are more of these coming in the future!\\n\\n### **Easier Navigation**\\n\\nOur first order of business is to declutter and reorganize. This is going to be a process, though. With some of the monolithic pages ([Mlflow Models](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/2.7.1/models.html)), this will be more of a marathon than a sprint.\\n\\nWe\'ve introduced a [new main navigation page](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html) in an effort to help steer you to the content that you\'re looking for based on end-use domain, rather than component of MLflow. We\'re hoping that this helps to bring new feature content and useful examples to your awareness, limiting the amount of exploratory discovery needed to understand how to use these new features.\\n\\nAnother priority for us was to make major new features easier to discover. While the [release notes](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) are useful, particularly for Engineers who are maintaining integrations with, or are managing a deployment of, MLflow, they\'re not particularly user-friendly for an end-user of MLflow. We felt that a curated list of major new features would help to distill the information in our release notes, so we built the [new features](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/new-features/index.html) page. We sincerely hope it helps to reduce the amount of effort needed to know what new major features have been released.\\n\\n### **Interactive Learning with Notebooks**\\n\\nIn today\'s fast-paced tech world, interactive learning is becoming the norm. Recognizing this trend, we\'re embedding viewable notebooks directly within the docs. But we\'re not stopping there. These notebooks are downloadable, allowing you to run, modify, and experiment with them locally. It\'s a hands-on approach to learning, bridging the gap between theory and practice.\\n\\n### **In-depth Tutorials and Guides**\\n\\nWhile our previous documentation provided a solid foundation, we felt there was room for more detailed explorations. We\'re introducing comprehensive [tutorials](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/traditional-ml/creating-custom-pyfunc/index.html) and [guides](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/llm-evaluate/index.html) that delve deep into MLflow\'s features, showing how to solve actual problems. These first new tutorials and guides are just the start. We\'re going to be spending a lot of time and effort on making much more of MLflow documented in this way, helping to dramatically reduce the amount of time you have to spend figuring out how to leverage features in MLflow.\\n\\n## Diving Deeper: Expanding on Guides and Tutorials\\n\\nOur dedication to simplifying the usage of MLflow shines through in our revamped tutorials and guides. We\'re not just providing instructions; we\'re offering [deep dives](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/custom-pyfunc-for-llms/notebooks/index.html), [best practices](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/traditional-ml/hyperparameter-tuning-with-child-runs/index.html), and real-world applications. What you see in the MLflow 2.8.0 release is just the beginning. We\'re going to be heavily focusing on creating more content, showing the best way to leverage the many features and services within MLflow, all the while endeavoring to make it easier than ever to manage any ML project you\'re working on.\\n\\n- **LLMs**: With all of the [new LLM-focused features](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/llm-evaluate/notebooks/rag-evaluation.html) we\'ve been releasing in the past year, we feel the need to create easier getting started guides,\\n  [in-depth tutorials](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/llm-evaluate/notebooks/question-answering-evaluation.html), runnable examples, and more teaching-oriented step-by-step introductions to these features.\\n\\n- **Tracking and the MLflow UI**: Our expanded section on tracking will cover everything from setting up your first experiment to advanced tracking techniques. The MLflow UI, an integral part of the platform, will also get its spotlight, ensuring you can make the most of its features.\\n\\n- **Model Registry**: The model registry is where MLflow truly shines, and our new guides will ensure you can harness its full power. From organizing models to version control, we\'ll cover it all.\\n\\n- **Recipes and LLM-focused Features**: MLflow\'s versatility is one of its strengths. Our new content will explore the breadth of features available, from recipes to LLM-focused tools like the AI Gateway, LLM Evaluation, and the PromptLab UI.\\n\\n## The Transformative Power of Interactive Notebooks\\n\\nInteractive notebooks have revolutionized data science and machine learning. By integrating them into our documentation, we aim to provide a holistic learning experience. You can see code in action, understand its impact, and then experiment on their own. It\'s a dynamic way to grasp complex concepts, ensuring that you not only understand but can also apply your knowledge in your actual project code.\\n\\n## Join Us on This Journey\\n\\nThe overhaul of the MLflow documentation is a significant milestone, but it\'s just the beginning. We have a roadmap full of exciting updates, new content, and features. And for those in our community with a passion for sharing knowledge, we have a message: We\'d love to [collaborate](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)! Whether it\'s writing tutorials, sharing use-cases, or providing feedback, every contribution enriches the MLflow community.\\n\\nIn conclusion, our commitment to providing top-notch documentation is a new primary focus of the maintainer group. We believe that well-documented features, combined with interactive learning tools, can significantly enhance the experience of using any tool. We want to put in the effort and time to make sure that your journey with using MLflow is as simple and powerful as it can be.\\n\\nStay tuned for more updates, and as always, happy coding!"}]}')}}]);
