By enabling autologging, traces are automatically logged to the active MLflow experiment when calling invocation APIs on chains. Here\u2019s a quick example:\\n\\n```python\\nimport os\\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\\nfrom langchain_openai import OpenAI\\nimport mlflow\\n\\nassert \\"OPENAI_API_KEY\\" in os.environ, \\"Please set your OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.\\"\\n\\nmlflow.set_experiment(\\"LangChain Tracing\\")\\nmlflow.langchain.autolog(log_models=True, log_input_examples=True)\\n\\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0.7, max_tokens=1000)\\nprompt_template = \\"Imagine you are {person}, and you are answering a question: {question}\\"\\nchain = prompt_template | llm\\n\\nchain.invoke({\\"person\\": \\"Richard Feynman\\", \\"question\\": \\"Why should we colonize Mars?\\"})\\nchain.invoke({\\"person\\": \\"Linus Torvalds\\", \\"question\\": \\"Can I set everyone\'s access to sudo?\\"})\\n\\n```\\n\\nAnd this is what you will see after invoking the chains when navigating to the **LangChain Tracing** experiment in the MLflow UI:\\n\\n![Traces in UI](tracing-ui.gif)\\n\\n### Fluent APIs for Manual Tracing\\n\\nFor more control, you can use MLflow\u2019s fluent APIs to manually instrument your code. This approach allows you to capture detailed trace data with minimal changes to your existing code.\\n\\n#### Trace Decorator\\n\\nThe trace decorator captures the inputs and outputs of a function:\\n\\n```python\\nimport mlflow\\n\\nmlflow.set_experiment(\\"Tracing Demo\\")\\n\\n@mlflow.trace\\ndef some_function(x, y, z=2):\\n    return x + (y - z)\\n\\nsome_function(2, 4)\\n```\\n\\n#### Context Handler\\n\\nThe context handler is ideal for supplementing span information with additional data at the point of information generation:\\n\\n```python\\nimport mlflow\\n\\n@mlflow.trace\\ndef first_func(x, y=2):\\n    return x + y\\n\\n@mlflow.trace\\ndef second_func(a, b=3):\\n    return a * b\\n\\ndef do_math(a, x, operation=\\"add\\"):\\n    with mlflow.start_span(name=\\"Math\\") as span:\\n        span.set_inputs({\\"a\\": a, \\"x\\": x})\\n        span.set_attributes({\\"mode\\": operation})\\n        first = first_func(x)\\n        second = second_func(a)\\n        result = first + second if operation == \\"add\\" else first - second\\n        span.set_outputs({\\"result\\": result})\\n        return result\\n\\ndo_math(8, 3, \\"add\\")\\n```\\n\\n### Comprehensive Tracing with Client APIs\\n\\nFor advanced use cases, the MLflow client API offers fine-grained control over trace management. These APIs allows you to create, manipulate, and retrieve traces programmatically, albeit with additional complexity throughout the implementation.\\n\\n#### Starting and Managing Traces with the Client APIs\\n\\n```python\\nfrom mlflow import MlflowClient\\n\\nclient = MlflowClient()\\n\\n# Start a new trace\\nroot_span = client.start_trace(\\"my_trace\\")\\nrequest_id = root_span.request_id\\n\\n# Create a child span\\nchild_span = client.start_span(\\n    name=\\"child_span\\",\\n    request_id=request_id,\\n    parent_id=root_span.span_id,\\n    inputs={\\"input_key\\": \\"input_value\\"},\\n    attributes={\\"attribute_key\\": \\"attribute_value\\"},\\n)\\n\\n# End the child span\\nclient.end_span(\\n    request_id=child_span.request_id,\\n    span_id=child_span.span_id,\\n    outputs={\\"output_key\\": \\"output_value\\"},\\n    attributes={\\"custom_attribute\\": \\"value\\"},\\n)\\n\\n# End the root span (trace)\\nclient.end_trace(\\n    request_id=request_id,\\n    outputs={\\"final_output_key\\": \\"final_output_value\\"},\\n    attributes={\\"token_usage\\": \\"1174\\"},\\n)\\n```\\n\\n## Diving Deeper into Tracing\\n\\nMLflow Tracing is designed to be flexible and powerful, supporting various use cases from simple function tracing to complex, asynchronous workflows.\\n\\nTo learn more about this feature, [read the guide](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html), [review the API Docs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow-tracing-fluent-python-apis) and [get started with the LangChain integration](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html#langchain-automatic-tracing) today!\\n\\n## Join Us on This Journey\\n\\nThe introduction of MLflow Tracing marks a significant milestone in our mission to provide comprehensive tools for managing machine learning workflows.

This practice is not only common, but also essential for developing specialized\\nmodels, particularly for tasks like text classification and summarization.\\n\\nIn such scenarios, tools like MLflow are invaluable. Tracking tools like MLflow help to ensure that every aspect of the training\\nprocess - metrics, parameters, and artifacts - are reproducibly tracked and logged, allowing for the analysis, comparison, and sharing of tuning iterations.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nIn this blog post, we are going to be using [MLflow 2.12](https://mlflow.org/releases/2.12.1) and the\\n[recently introduced MLflow Deep Learning features](https://mlflow.org/blog/deep-learning-part-1) to track all the important aspects of fine\\ntuning a large language model for text classification, including the use of automated logging of training checkpoints in order to simplify\\nthe process of resumption of training.\\n\\n## Use Case: Fine Tuning a Transformer Model for Text Classification\\n\\nThe example scenario that we\'re using within this blog utilizes the [unfair-TOS](https://huggingface.co/datasets/coastalcph/lex_glue/viewer/unfair_tos) dataset.\\n\\nIn today\u2019s world, it\u2019s hard to find a service, platform, or even a consumer good that doesn\u2019t have a legally-binding terms of service connected\\nwith it. These encyclopedic size agreements, filled with dense legal jargon and sometimes baffling levels of specificity, are so large that\\nmost people simply accept them without reading them. However, reports have indicated over time that occasionally, some suspiciously unfair\\nterms are embedded within them.\\n\\nAddressing unfair clauses in Terms of Service (TOS) agreements through machine learning (ML) is particularly relevant due to the pressing\\nneed for transparency and fairness in legal agreements that affect consumers. Consider the following clause from an example TOS\\nagreement: **\\"We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be retroactive, and the most current version of the Terms, which will always...\\"**\\nThis clause stipulates that the service provider may suspend or terminate the service at any time for any reason,\\nwith or without notice. Most people would consider this to be quite unfair.\\n\\nWhile this sentence is buried quite deeply within a fairly dense document, an ML algorithm is not burdened by the exhaustion that a human\\nwould have for combing through the text and identifying clauses that might seem a bit unfair. By automatically identifying potentially\\nunfair clauses, a transformers-based Deep Learning (DL) model can help protect consumers from exploitative practices, ensure greater compliance with legal standards,\\nand foster trust between service providers and users.\\n\\nA base pre-trained transformer model, without specialized fine-tuning, faces several challenges in accurately identifying unfair Terms of Service clauses.\\nFirstly, it lacks the domain-specific knowledge essential for understanding complex legal language. Secondly, its training objectives are\\ntoo general to capture the nuanced interpretation required for legal analysis. Lastly, it may not effectively recognize the subtle\\ncontextual meanings that determine the fairness of contractual terms, making it less effective for this specialized task.\\n\\nUsing prompt engineering to address the identification of unfair Terms of Service clauses with a closed-source Large language model\\ncan be prohibitively expensive. This approach requires extensive trial and error to refine prompts without the ability to tweak\\nthe underlying model mechanics. Each iteration can consume significant computational resources , especially when using\\n[few-shot prompting](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot), leading to escalating costs without guaranteeing a corresponding\\nincrease in accuracy or effectiveness.\\n\\nIn this context, the use of the **RoBERTa-base** model is particularly effective, provided that it is fine-tuned. This model is robust\\nenough to handle complex tasks like discerning embedded instructions within texts, yet it is sufficiently compact to be fine-tuned\\non modest hardware, such as an Nvidia T4 GPU.\\n\\n### What is PEFT?\\n\\n[Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/en/index) approaches are advantageous as they involve\\nkeeping the bulk of the pre-trained model parameters fixed while either only training a few additional layers or modifying the parameters used\\nwhen interacting with the model\'s weights. This methodology not only conserves memory during training, but also significantly reduces the overall training time. When\\ncompared with the alternative of fine-tuning a base model\'s weights in order to customize its performance for a specific targeted task, the PEFT\\napproach can save significant cost in both time and money, while providing an equivalent or better performance results with less data than is required\\nfor a comprehensive fine-tuning training task.\\n\\n## Integrating Hugging-Face models and the PyTorch Lightning framework\\n\\n[PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/) integrates seamlessly with\\n[Hugging Face\'s Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index), enabling streamlined model training workflows\\nthat capitalize on Lightning\'s easy-to-use Higher level API\u2019s and HF\'s state-of-the-art pre-trained models. The combination of Lightning with transformers\u2019\\n[PEFT module](https://huggingface.co/blog/peft) enhances productivity and scalability by reducing code complexity and enabling the use of\\nhigh-quality pre-optimized models for a range of diverse NLP tasks.\\n\\nBelow is an example of configuring the PEFT-based fine tuning of a base model using PyTorch Lightning and HuggingFace\'s `peft` module.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom typing import List\\nfrom lightning import LightningModule\\nfrom peft import get_peft_model, LoraConfig, TaskType\\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification\\n\\n\\nclass TransformerModule(LightningModule):\\n    def __init__(\\n        self,\\n        pretrained_model: str,\\n        num_classes: int = 2,\\n        lora_alpha: int = 32,\\n        lora_dropout: float = 0.1,\\n        r: int = 8,\\n        lr: float = 2e-4\\n    ):\\n        super().__init__()\\n        self.model = self.create_model(pretrained_model, num_classes, lora_alpha, lora_dropout, r)\\n        self.lr = lr\\n        self.save_hyperparameters(\\"pretrained_model\\")\\n\\n    def create_model(self, pretrained_model, num_classes, lora_alpha, lora_dropout, r):\\n        \\"\\"\\"Create and return the PEFT model with the given configuration.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            pretrained_model: The path or identifier for the pretrained model.\\n            num_classes: The number of classes for the sequence classification.\\n            lora_alpha: The alpha parameter for LoRA.\\n            lora_dropout: The dropout rate for LoRA.\\n            r: The rank of LoRA adaptations.\\n\\n        Returns:\\n            Model: A model configured with PEFT.\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\\n            pretrained_model_name_or_path=pretrained_model,\\n            num_labels=num_classes\\n        )\\n        peft_config = LoraConfig(\\n            task_type=TaskType.SEQ_CLS,\\n            inference_mode=False,\\n            r=r,\\n            lora_alpha=lora_alpha,\\n            lora_dropout=lora_dropout\\n        )\\n        return get_peft_model(model, peft_config)\\n\\n    def forward(self, input_ids: List[int], attention_mask: List[int], label: List[int]):\\n        \\"\\"\\"Calculate the loss by passing inputs to the model and comparing against ground truth labels.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            input_ids: List of token indices to be fed to the model.\\n            attention_mask: List to indicate to the model which tokens should be attended to, and which should not.\\n            label: List of ground truth labels associated with the input data.\\n\\n        Returns:\\n            torch.Tensor: The computed loss from the model as a tensor.\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        return self.model(\\n            input_ids=input_ids,\\n            attention_mask=attention_mask,\\n            labels=label\\n        )\\n```\\n\\nAdditional references for the full implementation can be [seen within the companion repository here](https://github.com/puneet-jain159/deeplearning_with_mlfow/blob/master/custom_module/fine_tune_clsify_head.py)\\n\\n## Configuring MLflow for PEFT-based fine-tuning\\n\\nBefore initiating the training process, it\'s crucial to configure MLFlow so that all system metrics, loss metrics, and parameters are logged for the training run.\\nAs of MLFlow 2.12, auto-logging for TensorFlow and PyTorch now includes support for checkpointing model weights during training, giving a snapshot of the model\\nweights at defined epoch frequencies in order to provide for training resumption in the case of an error or loss of the compute environment.\\nBelow is an example of how to enable this feature:\\n\\n```python\\nimport mlflow\\n\\n\\nmlflow.enable_system_metrics_logging()\\nmlflow.pytorch.autolog(checkpoint_save_best_only = False, checkpoint_save_freq=\'epoch\')\\n```\\n\\nIn the code above we are doing the following:\\n\\n- **Enabling System Metrics Logging**: The system resources will be logged to MLflow in order to understand where bottlenecks in memory, CPU, GPU, disk usage, and network traffic are throughout the training process.\\n\\n![MLflow UI System Metrics](sys_metrics.png)\\n\\n- **Configuring Auto Logging to log parameters, metrics and checkpoints for all epochs**: Deep learning involves experimenting with various model architectures and hyperparameter settings. Auto logging plays a crucial role in systematically recording these experiments, making it easier to compare different runs and determine which configurations yield the best results. Checkpoints are logged at every epoch, enabling detailed evaluations of all intermediate epochs during the initial exploration phase of the project. However, it is generally not advisable to log all epochs during late-stage development to avoid excessive data writes and latency in the final training stages.\\n\\n![System Metrics Logged](epoch_logging.png)\\n\\nThe auto-logged checkpoint metrics and model artifacts will be viewable in the MLflow UI as the model trains, as shown below:\\n\\n![Metrics logged with each epoch](checkpoint_metrics.png)\\n\\n## The Importance of Logging and Early-stopping\\n\\nThe integration of the Pytorch Lightning `Trainer` callback with MLflow is crucial within this training exercise. The integration allows for comprehensive\\ntracking and logging of metrics, parameters, and artifacts during model finetuning without having to explicitly call MLflow logging APIs. Additionally,\\nthe autologging API allows for modifying the default logging behavior, permitting changes to the logging frequency, allowing for logging to occur at each\\nepoch, after a specified number of epochs, or at explicitly defined steps.\\n\\n### Early stopping\\n\\nEarly stopping is a critical regularization technique in neural network training, designed to assist in preventing overfitting through the act of\\nhalting training when validation performance plateaus. Pytorch Lightning includes APIs that allow for an easy high-level control of training cessation,\\nas demonstrated below.\\n\\n### Configuring Pytorch Trainer Callback with Early stopping\\n\\nThe example below shows the configuration of the `Trainer` object within `Lightning` to leverage early stopping to prevent overfitting. Once configured, the\\ntraining is executed by calling `fit` on the `Trainer` object. By providing the `EarlyStopping` callback, in conjunction with MLflow\'s autologging, the\\nappropriate number of epochs will be used, logged, and tracked without any additional effort.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\\nimport os\\n\\nfrom data import LexGlueDataModule\\nfrom lightning import Trainer\\nfrom lightning.pytorch.callbacks import EarlyStopping\\nimport mlflow\\n\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass TrainConfig:\\n    pretrained_model: str = \\"bert-base-uncased\\"\\n    num_classes: int = 2\\n    lr: float = 2e-4\\n    max_length: int = 128\\n    batch_size: int = 256\\n    num_workers: int = os.cpu_count()\\n    max_epochs: int = 10\\n    debug_mode_sample: int | None = None\\n    max_time: dict[str, float] = field(default_factory=lambda: {\\"hours\\": 3})\\n    model_checkpoint_dir: str = \\"/local_disk0/tmp/model-checkpoints\\"\\n    min_delta: float = 0.005\\n    patience: int = 4\\n\\ntrain_config = TrainConfig()\\n\\n# Instantiate the custom Transformer class for PEFT training\\nnlp_model = TransformerModule(\\n        pretrained_model=train_config.pretrained_model,\\n        num_classes=train_config.num_classes,\\n        lr=train_config.lr,\\n    )\\n\\ndatamodule = LexGlueDataModule(\\n        pretrained_model=train_config.pretrained_model,\\n        max_length=train_config.max_length,\\n        batch_size=train_config.batch_size,\\n        num_workers=train_config.num_workers,\\n        debug_mode_sample=train_config.debug_mode_sample,\\n    )\\n\\n# Log system metrics while training loop is running\\nmlflow.enable_system_metrics_logging()\\n\\n# Automatically log per-epoch parameters, metrics, and checkpoint weights\\nmlflow.pytorch.autolog(checkpoint_save_best_only = False)\\n\\n# Define the Trainer configuration\\ntrainer = Trainer(\\n   callbacks=[\\n       EarlyStopping(\\n           monitor=\\"Val_F1_Score\\",\\n           min_delta=train_config.min_delta,\\n           patience=train_config.patience,\\n           verbose=True,\\n           mode=\\"max\\",\\n       )\\n   ],\\n   default_root_dir=train_config.model_checkpoint_dir,\\n   fast_dev_run=bool(train_config.debug_mode_sample),\\n   max_epochs=train_config.max_epochs,\\n   max_time=train_config.max_time,\\n   precision=\\"32-true\\"\\n)\\n\\n# Execute the training run\\ntrainer.fit(model=nlp_model, datamodule=datamodule)\\n```\\n\\n## Visualization and Sharing Capabilities within MLflow\\n\\nThe newly introduced DL-specific visualization capabilities introduced in MLflow 2.12 enable you to make comparisons between different runs and artifacts over epochs.\\nWhen comparing training runs, MLflow is capable of generating useful visualization that can be integrated into dashboards, facilitating\\neasy sharing. Additionally, the centralized storage of metrics, in conjunction with parameters, allows for effective analysis of the training\\nefficacy, as shown in the image below.\\n\\n![Epoch Run Compare](compare.png)\\n\\n## When to stop training?\\n\\nWhen training DL models, it is important to understand when to stop. Efficient training (for minimizing the overall cost incurred for\\nconducting training) and optimal model performance rely heavily on preventing a model from overfitting on the training data. A model\\nthat trains for too long will invariably become quite good at effectively \u2018memorizing\u2019 the training data, resulting in a reduction in\\nthe performance of the model when presented with novel data. A straightforward way to evaluate this behavior is to ensure that\\nvalidation data set metrics (scoring loss metrics on data that is not in the training data set) are captured during the training\\nloop. Integrating the MLflow callback into the PyTorch Lightning Trainer allows for iterative logging of loss metrics at\\nconfigurable iterations, enabling an easily debuggable evaluation of the training performance, ensuring that stopping criteria\\ncan be enforced at the appropriate time to prevent overfitting.\\n\\n### Evaluating epoch checkpoints of Fine Tuned Models with MLflow\\n\\nWith your training process meticulously tracked and logged by MLflow, you have the flexibility to retrieve and test your model at\\nany arbitrary checkpoint. To do this, you can use the mlflow.pytorch.load_model() API to load the model from a specific run\\nand use the `predict()` method for evaluation.\\n\\nIn the example below, we will load the model checkpoint from the 3rd epoch and use the `Lightning` train module to generate predictions based on the\\ncheckpoint state of the saved training epoch.\\n\\n```python\\nimport mlflow\\n\\n\\nmlflow.pytorch.autolog(disable = True)\\n\\nrun_id = \'<Add the run ID>\'\\n\\nmodel = mlflow.pytorch.load_checkpoint(TransformerModule, run_id, 3)\\n\\nexamples_to_test = [\\"We reserve the right to modify the service price at any time and retroactively apply the adjusted price to historical service usage.\\"]\\n\\ntrain_module = Trainer()\\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(train_config.pretrained_model)\\ntokens = tokenizer(examples_to_test,\\n                  max_length=train_config.max_length,\\n                  padding=\\"max_length\\",\\n                  truncation=True)\\nds = Dataset.from_dict(dict(tokens))\\nds.set_format(\\n            type=\\"torch\\", columns=[\\"input_ids\\", \\"attention_mask\\"]\\n        )\\n\\ntrain_module.predict(model, dataloaders = DataLoader(ds))\\n```\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nThe integration of MLflow into the finetuning process of pre-trained language models, particularly for applications like custom\\nnamed entity recognition, text classification and instruction-following represents a significant advancement in managing and\\noptimizing deep learning workflows. Leveraging the autologging and tracking capabilities of MLflow in these workstreams not only\\nenhances the reproducibility and efficiency of model development, but also fosters a collaborative environment where insights\\nand improvements can be easily shared and implemented.\\n\\nAs we continue to push the boundaries of what these models can achieve, tools like MLflow will be instrumental in harnessing their full potential.\\n\\nIf you\'re interested in seeing the full example in its entirety, feel free to [see the full example implementation](https://github.com/puneet-jain159/deeplearning_with_mlfow)\\n\\n### Check out the code\\n\\nThe code we provide will delve into additional aspects such as training from a checkpoint, integrating MLflow and TensorBoard, and utilizing Pyfunc for model wrapping, among others.

However, with an increased velocity on major feature development comes with a risk of breaking things. As the maintainers of such a widely used project, we are cognizant of the disruptive nature of regressions and we strive to avoid them as much as we can. Aside from new feature development work, our primary goal is in ensuring the stability of production systems. While we do have the aspirational goal of moving fast(er), we certainly don\'t want to move fast and break things. With that goal in mind, we\'ve decided to introduce a release candidate (RC) process. The RC process allows us to introduce new features and fixes in a controlled environment before they become part of the official release.\\n\\n## How It Works\\n\\nStarting from MLflow 2.13.0, new MLflow major and minor releases will be tagged as release candidates (e.g., `2.13.0rc0`) in PyPI two weeks before they are officially released.\\n\\nThe release candidate process involves several key stages:\\n\\n- Feature Development Freeze: Prior to cutting the RC branch and announcing its availability, we will freeze the RC branch from feature commits. Once the branch is cut, only bug fix and stability PRs will be permitted to be merged, ensuring that unexpected, late-arriving, potentially regression-causing merges are not permitted to destabilize the forthcoming release.\\n- Pre-Release Announcement: We will announce upcoming features and improvements, providing our community with a roadmap of what to expect.\\n- Release Candidate Rollout: A release candidate version will be made available for testing, accompanied by detailed release notes outlining the changes.\\n- Community Testing and Feedback: We encourage our users to test the release candidate in their environments and share their feedback with us by filing issue reports on the MLflow Github repository. This feedback is invaluable for identifying issues and ensuring the final release aligns with user needs (i.e., we didn\'t break your workflows).\\n- Final Release: After incorporating feedback and making necessary adjustments, we will proceed with the final release. This version will include all updates tested in the RC phase, offering a polished and stable experience for all users.\\n\\nThis approach provides several benefits:\\n\\n- Enhanced Stability: By rigorously testing release candidates, we can identify and address potential issues early, reducing the likelihood of disruptions in production environments.\\n- Community Feedback: The RC phase offers you, a member of the MLflow community, the opportunity to provide feedback on upcoming changes. This collaborative approach ensures that the final release aligns with the needs and expectations of our users.\\n- Gradual Adoption: Users can choose to experiment with new features in a release candidate without committing to a full upgrade. This flexibility supports cautious integration and thorough evaluation in various environments.\\n\\n## Get Involved\\n\\nYour participation is crucial to the success of this process. We invite you to join us in testing upcoming release candidates and sharing your insights. Together, we can ensure that MLflow continues to serve as a reliable foundation for your machine learning projects.\\nStay tuned for announcements regarding our first release candidate. We look forward to your contributions and feedback as we take this important step toward a more stable and dependable MLflow."},{"id":"deep-learning-part-1","metadata":{"permalink":"/mlflow-website/blog/deep-learning-part-1","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-05-deep-learning-part-1/index.md","title":"Announcing MLflow Enhancements - Deep Learning with MLflow (Part 1)","description":"Highlighting the recent improvements in MLflow for Deep Learning workflows","date":"2024-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 5, 2024","tags":[{"label":"Deep Learning","permalink":"/mlflow-website/blog/tags/deep-learning"}],"readingTime":5.175,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Abe Omorogbe","title":"Product Manager, ML at Databricks","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abeomor/","imageURL":"/img/authors/abe.png","key":"abe-omorogbe"},{"name":"Hubert Zub","title":"Software Engineer at Databricks","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hubert-zub/","imageURL":"/img/authors/hubert.png","key":"hubert-zub"},{"name":"Yun Park","title":"Software Engineer at Databricks","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yunpark93/","imageURL":"/img/authors/yun.png","key":"yun-park"},{"name":"Chen Qian","title":"Software Engineer at Databricks","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-chen-qian/","imageURL":"/img/authors/chen.png","key":"chen-qian"},{"name":"Jesse Chan","title":"Software Engineer at Databricks","key":"jesse-chan"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Announcing MLflow Enhancements - Deep Learning with MLflow (Part 1)","description":"Highlighting the recent improvements in MLflow for Deep Learning workflows","slug":"deep-learning-part-1","authors":["abe-omorogbe","hubert-zub","yun-park","chen-qian","jesse-chan"],"tags":["Deep Learning"],"thumbnail":"img/blog/dl-chart-grouping.gif"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"MLflow Release Candidates","permalink":"/mlflow-website/blog/release-candidates"},"nextItem":{"title":"2023 Year in Review","permalink":"/mlflow-website/blog/mlflow-year-in-review"}},"content":"In the quickly evolving world of artificial intelligence, where generative AI has taken center stage, the landscape of machine learning is\\nevolving at an unprecedented pace.

These improvements encompass expanded scalability options, support for logging more iterations and the\\nlogging of system metrics.\\n\\n### System Metrics\\n\\nThis feature allows you to [monitor system metrics](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/system-metrics/index.html?highlight=system) and identify any hardware issues that might be impacting performance.\\nMetrics such as CPU utilization, Memory usage, disk usage etc., from all nodes in your cluster can now be logged and visualized within the MLflow UI.\\n\\n![System Metrics](system-metrics.png)\\n\\n### Improved Logging Performance\\n\\nWe recently introduced both asynchronous and batch logging, making it easier to log both\\n[parallel and distributed](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking/tracking-api.html#parallel-runs) DL training sessions. Additionally, the MLflow Client\\nnow supports up to **1 million** steps (iterations) when logging metrics, allowing users to log more steps during long-running DL jobs.\\n\\n![Parallel Runs](parallel-runs.png)\\n\\n### Checkpointing for Deep Learning\\n\\n[TensorFlow](https://mlflow.org/releases/2.11.0#autologging-for-tensorflow-and-pytorch-now-supports-checkpointing-of-model-weights:~:text=both%20PyTorch%20and-,TensorFlow,-for%20automatic%20model)\\nand [PyTorch](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pytorch.html#mlflow.pytorch.autolog) now support model weight checkpointing when\\nusing autologging.\\n\\n![DL Checkpointing](dl-checkpointing.png)\\n\\n## User Experience and Productivity Enhancements\\n\\nWe have introduced substantial improvements to user experience and feature organization within our platform. These enhancements include more\\nsophisticated user interfaces and an intuitive redesign of the run details page, the addition of chart groups and metric aggregation, all\\naimed at simplifying navigation and enhancing productivity especially for Deep Learning use cases.\\n\\n### Metric Aggregation\\n\\nWe\'ve enhanced the UI with metric aggregation, enabling you to aggregate metrics across multiple runs based on\\ndatasets, tags, or parameters. These improvements significantly improve the time it takes to understand training results when working\\nwith large DL models, enabling more nuanced and comprehensive analysis of overarching trends in model performance across multiple dimensions.\\n\\n![DL Metric Aggregation](dl-metric-aggregation.gif)\\n\\n### Chart Grouping Functionality\\n\\nYou can now easily categorize and organize your metrics, such as training, testing, and system metrics into\\nnamed groups within the MLflow UI. This organization allows for a comprehensive overview of all metrics, enabling quicker access and\\nbetter management, particularly when handling experiments with many metrics.\\n\\n![DL Chart Grouping](dl-chart-grouping.gif)\\n\\n### Slash (\\"/\\") Logging Syntax\\n\\nTo further streamline metric organization, we\'ve implemented a new logging syntax that uses slashes\\n(\\"/\\") to group metrics. For example, using mlflow.log_metric(\\"x/y/score\\", 100) helps in structuring and segregating different types\\nof data or metrics into hierarchical groups, making it easier to navigate and interpret the logs, especially when dealing with complex\\nmodels and experiments.\\n\\n```python\\n\\nmlflow.log_metric(\'SVR/val_MAPE\', mean_absolute_percentage_error(test_y, pred_y))\\n\\n```\\n\\n![DL Slash Logging](dl-slash-logging.png)\\n\\n### Chart Searching\\n\\nWe\'ve significantly enhanced the search functionality within our platform, enabling more robust and intuitive searching\\nacross charts, parameters, and metrics. This upgrade allows for quicker and more precise retrieval of specific data points, streamlining the\\nprocess of analyzing and comparing different aspects of your experiments.\\n\\n![DL Chart Searching](dl-chart-searching.gif)\\n\\n### Run Details Redesign\\n\\nWe reorganized the Run Details UI to a modular tabbed layout, added new drag and drop UI functionality so that you can\\ncan now render logged tables.

Creating a Databricks CE Account\\n\\nIf you haven\'t already, you can [sign up for a free account](https://www.databricks.com/try-databricks#account). The process is quick, typically taking no more than 3 minutes.\\n\\nFill out the signup form and select \u201cGet started with Community Edition.\u201d\\n\\n![Databricks CE Signup Page](ce-signup.png)\\n\\nOnce signed up, you\'ll get information on how to set a password that you can use to login to CE with[^2].\\n\\n[^2]: Databricks CE only supports basic authorization signin (username / password). For more advanced and secure authorization setups, only the full Databricks product supports those.\\n\\n#### 2. Installing Dependencies\\n\\nBefore you start, ensure that you have the necessary packages installed. Run the following command in your favorite IDE or notebook from your device:\\n\\n```bash\\n%pip install -q mlflow databricks-sdk\\n```\\n\\n#### 3. Setting Up Databricks CE Authentication\\n\\nThe main advantage of Databricks Community Edition (CE) is its convenience: it offers an MLflow tracking server without requiring\\n[local infrastructure setup](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/getting-started/logging-first-model/step1-tracking-server.html). You can easily access this server through the\\n[mlflow.login()](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.login) function after creating your CE account, streamlining the process for MLflow experiment tracking.\\n\\nTo authenticate with Databricks CE, use the [mlflow.login()](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.login) function. This will prompt you for:\\n\\n- **Databricks Host**: `https://community.cloud.databricks.com/`\\n\\n- **Username**: Your Databricks CE email address.\\n\\n- **Password**: Your Databricks CE password.\\n\\nUpon successful authentication, you will see a confirmation message.\\n\\n```python\\nimport mlflow\\n\\nmlflow.login()\\n\\n# Follow the prompts for authentication\\n```\\n\\n#### 4. Connect to Hosted MLflow and Track Experiments with Databricks CE\\n\\nAfter you login from your local machine, start an experiment with [mlflow.set_experiment()](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html?highlight=mlflow%20set_experiment#mlflow.set_experiment) and log some metrics. For instance:\\n\\n```python\\nmlflow.set_experiment(\\"/Users/\\\\<email>/check-databricks-ce-connection\\")\\n\\nwith mlflow.start_run():\\n\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0mlflow.log_metric(\\"foo\\", 1)\\n\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0mlflow.log_metric(\\"bar\\", 2)\\n```\\n\\n> **Note**: The Databricks environment requires you to set experiments with the directory (from root)\\n\\n    `/Users/{your email address for your account}/{name of your experiment}`, which is different from the behavior in self-hosted MLflow (and when running MLFlow locally).\\n\\n#### 5. Viewing Your Experiment in Databricks CE\\n\\nNow let\u2019s navigate to Databricks CE to view the experiment result. Log in to your [Databricks CE](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/)\\naccount, and click on the top left to select machine learning in the drop down list. Finally, click on the experiment icon. See the screenshots below:\\n\\nNavigate to the Machine Learning Section\\n\\n![Navigate to ML Section of Databricks CE](navigate-to-experiments.png)\\n\\nNavigate to the MLflow UI\\n\\n![Navigate to the MLflow UI on Databricks CE](navigate-to-mlflow-ui.png)\\n\\nIn the \u201cExperiments\u201d view, you should be able to find the experiment `/Users/{your email}/check-databricks-ce-connection`, similar to:\\n\\n![Experiment view of Databricks MLflow server](view-experiment.png)\\n\\nClicking on the run name, which in this example is \'youthful-lamb-287\' (note that you will see a different, randomly generated name in your CE console),\\nwill take you to the run view that looks similar to the following:\\n\\n![Run view of Databricks MLflow server](view-run.png)\\n\\nIn the run view, you will see our dummy metrics `\u201cfoo\u201d` and `\u201cbar\u201d` have been logged successfully.\\n\\n#### 6. Run any MLflow tutorial in Databricks CE\\n\\nIf you want to try a tutorial from the MLflow website, you can use Databricks CE to quickly test (and modify, if you\'re inclined) the tutorial. For example, if you wanted to test\\nthe [Creating Custom Pyfunc tutorial](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/traditional-ml/creating-custom-pyfunc/notebooks/basic-pyfunc.html):\\n\\n1. Click Workspace and\xa0 select \u201cImport notebook\u201d\\n\\n![Import a Notebook](import-notebook.png)\\n\\n2. Use the `URL` option to import the notebook directly from the MLflow documentation website. For this example, to import, replace the last element of the url\\n   from `html` to `ipynb`. This can be done with any of the tutorial or guide notebooks that are hosted on the MLflow website.\\n\\n   .../notebooks/basic-pyfunc.~~html~~ &rarr; .../notebooks/basic-pyfunc.**ipynb**[^3]\\n\\n[^3]: Or you can [download the notebook](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/traditional-ml/creating-custom-pyfunc/notebooks/basic-pyfunc.ipynb) and manually load it in the UI by selecting `File` instead of `URL`.\\n\\n![Select the Notebook for Importing](import-notebook-2.png)\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nDatabricks Community Edition (CE) offers an accessible and collaborative platform for MLflow experiment tracking, presenting several advantages. Its setup process is effortless\\nand quick, providing a user-friendly experience.

For example,\\n[mlflow.sklearn.log_model](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.sklearn.html#mlflow.sklearn.log_model)\\nwill log a scikit-learn model as an MLflow artifact without requiring you to define custom methods for\\nprediction or for handling artifacts.\\n\\nIn some cases, however, you might be working in a framework for which MLflow does not have\\nbuilt-in methods, or you might want something different than the model\u2019s default prediction\\noutputs. In those cases, MLflow allows you to create custom models to work with essentially\\nany framework and to integrate custom logic to existing supported frameworks.\\n\\nIn its simplest form, all that\u2019s required is to define a custom predict method and log the model.\\nThe following example defines a simple pyfunc model that just returns the square of its input:\\n\\n```python\\nimport mlflow\\n\\n# Define a custom model\\nclass MyModel(mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel):\\n    def predict(self, context, model_input):\\n        # Directly return the square of the input\\n        return model_input**2\\n\\n\\n# Save the model\\nwith mlflow.start_run():\\n    model_info = mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(\\n        artifact_path=\\"model\\",\\n        python_model=MyModel()\\n    )\\n\\n# Load the model\\nloaded_model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(\\n    model_uri=model_info.model_uri\\n)\\n\\n# Predict\\nloaded_model.predict(2)\\n```\\n\\nLet\u2019s dig into how this works, starting with some basic concepts.\\n\\n## Models and Model Flavors\\n\\n![Models and Flavors](models-and-flavors.png)\\n\\nAn MLflow model is a directory that includes everything needed to reproduce a machine learning model\\nacross different environments. Aside from the stored model itself, the most important component\\nstored is an `MLmodel` YAML file that specifies the model\u2019s supported model flavors.\\nA [model flavor](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/traditional-ml/creating-custom-pyfunc/part1-named-flavors.html#components-of-a-model-in-mlflow)\\nis a set of rules specifying how MLflow can interact with the model (i.e., save it, load it, and\\nget predictions from it).\\n\\nWhen you create a custom model in MLflow, it has the `python_function` or pyfunc model flavor,\\nwhich is a kind of \u201cuniversal translator\u201d across formats in MLflow. When you save a model in MLflow\\nusing a built-in model flavor, e.g. with [mlflow.sklearn.log_model](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.sklearn.html#mlflow.sklearn.log_model),\\nthat model also has the pyfunc model flavor in addition to its framework-specific flavor.\\nHaving both framework-specific and pyfunc model flavors allows you to use the model via the\\nframework\u2019s native API (e.g., `scikit-learn`) or via the pyfunc flavor\u2019s framework-agnostic inference API.\\n\\nModels with the pyfunc flavor are loaded as instances of the [mlflow.pyfunc.PyfuncModel](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html?highlight=pyfunc#mlflow.pyfunc.PyFuncModel)\\nclass, which exposes a standardized predict method. This enables straightforward inference through a single\\nfunction call, regardless of the underlying model\'s implementation details.\\n\\n## Defining Custom MLflow Pyfunc Models\\n\\nSaving a model from any supported machine learning framework as an MLflow model results in the\\ncreation of a pyfunc model flavor that provides a framework-agnostic interface for managing and\\nusing the model. But what if you\u2019re using a framework without an MLflow integration, or you\u2019re\\ntrying to elicit some custom behavior from a model? [Custom pyfunc models](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#creating-custom-pyfunc-models)\\nallow you to work with essentially any framework and to integrate custom logic.\\n\\nTo implement a custom pyfunc model, define a new Python class inheriting from the PythonModel class\\nand implement the necessary methods. Minimally, this will involve implementing a custom predict\\nmethod. Next, create an instance of your model and log or save the model. Once you\u2019ve loaded the\\nsaved or logged model, you can use it for predictions.\\n\\n![Creating a custom model](custom-model-creation.png)\\n\\nLet\u2019s work through a few examples, each adding a little more complexity and highlighting different\\naspects of defining a custom pyfunc model. We\u2019ll cover four main techniques for implementing custom\\nbehaviors in pyfunc models:\\n\\n1. Implementing a custom `predict` method\\n2. Implementing a custom `__init__` method\\n3. Implementing a custom `load_context` method\\n4. Implementing user-defined custom methods\\n\\n![Pyfunc model customization](custom-pyfunc-types.png)\\n\\n### Defining a custom `predict` method\\n\\nAt a minimum, a pyfunc model should specify a custom predict method that defines what happens when\\nwe call `model.predict`. Here\u2019s an example of a custom model that applies a simple linear\\ntransformation to the model inputs, multiplying each input by two and adding three:\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport mlflow\\nfrom mlflow.pyfunc import PythonModel\\n\\n\\n# Custom PythonModel class\\nclass SimpleLinearModel(PythonModel):\\n    def predict(self, context, model_input):\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        Applies a simple linear transformation\\n        to the input data. For example, y = 2x + 3.\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        # Assuming model_input is a pandas DataFrame with one column\\n        return pd.DataFrame(2 * model_input + 3)\\n\\n\\nwith mlflow.start_run():\\n    model_info = mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(\\n        artifact_path=\\"linear_model\\",\\n        python_model=SimpleLinearModel(),\\n        input_example=pd.DataFrame([10, 20, 30]),\\n    )\\n```\\n\\nNote that you can (and should) also include a [signature](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#model-signature)\\nand an [input example](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#model-input-example) when saving/logging a\\nmodel. If you pass an input example, the signature will be inferred automatically. The model\\nsignature provides a way for MLflow to enforce correct usage of your model.\\n\\nOnce we\u2019ve defined the model path and saved an instance of the model, we can load the saved model\\nand use it to generate predictions:\\n\\n```python\\n# Now the model can be loaded and used for predictions\\nloaded_model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(model_uri=model_info.model_uri)\\nmodel_input = pd.DataFrame([1, 2, 3])  # Example input data\\nprint(loaded_model.predict(model_input))  # Outputs transformed data\\n```\\n\\nWhich will return:\\n\\n```text\\n:    0\\n: 0  5\\n: 1  7\\n: 2  9\\n```\\n\\nNote that if a custom `predict` method is all you need\u2014that is, if your model does not have any\\nartifacts that require special handling\u2014you can save or log the `predict` method directly without\\nneeding to wrap it in a Python class:\\n\\n```python\\nimport mlflow\\nimport pandas as pd\\n\\n\\ndef predict(model_input):\\n    \\"\\"\\"\\n    Applies a simple linear transformation\\n    to the input data. For example, y = 2x + 3.\\n    \\"\\"\\"\\n    # Assuming model_input is a pandas DataFrame with one column\\n    return pd.DataFrame(2 * model_input + 3)\\n\\n\\n# Pass predict method as python_model argument to save/log model\\nwith mlflow.start_run():\\n    model_info = mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(\\n        artifact_path=\\"simple_function\\",\\n        python_model=predict,\\n        input_example=pd.DataFrame([10, 20, 30]),\\n    )\\n```\\n\\nNote that with this approach, we **must include** an input example along with the custom predict\\nmethod. We also have to modify the predict method such that it takes only one input (i.e., no self or context).\\nRunning this example and then loading with the same code as the preceding code block will retain the same output as\\nthe example using a class definiton.\\n\\n### Parameterizing the custom model\\n\\nNow suppose we want to parameterize the custom linear function model so that it can be used with\\ndifferent slopes and intercepts. We can define the `__init__` method to set up custom parameters,\\nas in the following example. Note that the custom model class\u2019s `__init__` method should not be used\\nto load external resources like data files or pretrained models; these are handled in the\\n`load_context` method, which we\u2019ll discuss shortly.\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport mlflow\\nfrom mlflow.pyfunc import PythonModel\\n\\n\\n# Custom PythonModel class\\nclass ParameterizedLinearModel(PythonModel):\\n    def __init__(self, slope, intercept):\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        Initialize the parameters of the model. Note that we are not loading\\n        any external resources here, just setting up the parameters.\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        self.slope = slope\\n        self.intercept = intercept\\n\\n    def predict(self, context, model_input):\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        Applies a simple linear transformation\\n        to the input data. For example, y = 2x + 3.\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        # Assuming model_input is a pandas DataFrame with one column\\n        return pd.DataFrame(self.slope * model_input + self.intercept)\\n\\n\\nlinear_model = ParameterizedLinearModel(10, 20)\\n\\n# Saving the model with mlflow\\nwith mlflow.start_run():\\n    model_info = mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(\\n        artifact_path=\\"parameter_model\\",\\n        python_model=linear_model,\\n        input_example=pd.DataFrame([10, 20, 30]),\\n    )\\n```\\n\\nAgain, we can load this model and make some predictions:\\n\\n```python\\nloaded_model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(model_uri=model_info.model_uri)\\nmodel_input = pd.DataFrame([1, 2, 3])  # Example input data\\nprint(loaded_model.predict(model_input))  # Outputs transformed data\\n```\\n\\n```text\\n:     0\\n: 0  30\\n: 1  40\\n: 2  50\\n```\\n\\nThere are many cases where we might want to parameterize a model in this manner. We can define\\nvariables in the `__init__` method to:\\n\\n- Set model hyperparameters.\\n- A/B test models with different parameter sets.\\n- Set user-specific customizations.\\n- Toggle features.\\n- Set, e.g., access credentials and endpoints for models that access external APIs.\\n\\nIn some cases, we may want to be able to pass parameters at inference time rather than when we\\ninitialize the model. This can be accomplished with\\n[model inference params](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#model-inference-params). To use\\ninference params, we must pass a valid model signature including `params`. Here\u2019s how to adapt the\\npreceding example to use inference params:\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport mlflow\\nfrom mlflow.models import infer_signature\\nfrom mlflow.pyfunc import PythonModel\\n\\n\\n# Custom PythonModel class\\nclass LinearFunctionInferenceParams(PythonModel):\\n    def predict(self, context, model_input, params):\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        Applies a simple linear transformation\\n        to the input data. For example, y = 2x + 3.\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        slope = params[\\"slope\\"]\\n        # Assuming model_input is a pandas DataFrame with one column\\n        return pd.DataFrame(slope * model_input + params[\\"intercept\\"])\\n\\n\\n# Set default params\\nparams = {\\"slope\\": 2, \\"intercept\\": 3}\\n\\n# Define model signature\\nsignature = infer_signature(model_input=pd.DataFrame([10, 20, 30]), params=params)\\n\\n# Save the model with mlflow\\nwith mlflow.start_run():\\n    model_info = mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(\\n        artifact_path=\\"model_with_params\\",\\n        python_model=LinearFunctionInferenceParams(),\\n        signature=signature,\\n    )\\n```\\n\\nAfter loading the model as before, you can now pass a `params` argument to the `predict` method,\\nenabling you to use the same loaded model for different combinations of parameters:\\n\\n```python\\nloaded_model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(model_uri=model_info.model_uri)\\n\\nparameterized_predictions = loaded_model.predict(\\n    pd.DataFrame([10, 20, 30]), params={\\"slope\\": 2, \\"intercept\\": 10}\\n)\\nprint(parameterized_predictions)\\n```\\n\\n```text\\n:     0\\n: 0  30\\n: 1  50\\n: 2  70\\n```\\n\\n### Loading external resources with `load_context`\\n\\nCustom models often require external files such as model weights in order to perform inference.\\nThese files, or artifacts, must be handled carefully to avoid unnecessarily loading files into\\nmemory or errors during model serialization. When building custom pyfunc models in MLflow, you can\\nuse the `load_context` method to handle model artifacts correctly.\\n\\nThe `load_context` method receives a `context` object containing artifacts the model can use during\\ninference. You can specify these artifacts using the `artifacts` argument when saving or logging\\nmodels, making them accessible to the `load_context` method via the `context.artifacts` dictionary.\\n\\nIn practice, the `load_context` method often initializes the model called by the `predict` method by\\nhandling the loading of model artifacts.\\n\\nThis raises an important question: why do we load artifacts and define the model in the `load_context`\\nmethod and not in `__init__` or directly in `predict`? Correct usage of `load_context` is essential\\nfor the maintainability, efficiency, scalability, and portability of MLflow pyfunc models. This is because:\\n\\n- The `load_context` method is executed once when the model is loaded via `mlflow.pyfunc.load_model`.\\n  This setup ensures that resource-intensive processes defined within this method, such as loading\\n  large model files, are not repeated unnecessarily. If artifact loading is done in the predict\\n  method, it will occur every single time a prediction is made. This is highly inefficient for\\n  resource-intensive models.\\n- Saving or logging an MLflow `pyfunc` model involves serializing the Python model class (the subclass\\n  of [mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel)\\n  you created) and its attributes. Complex ML models are not always compatible with the methods used\\n  to serialize the Python object, which can lead to errors if they are created as attributes of the Python object.\\n\\nAs an example, suppose we want to load a large language model (LLM) in the `gguf` model format\\n(a file format designed for storing models for inference) and run it with the\\n[ctransformers library](https://pypi.org/project/ctransformers). At the time of writing, there is\\nno built-in model flavor that lets us use `gguf` models for inference, so we\u2019ll create a custom\\npyfunc model that loads the required libraries and model files in the `load_context` method.\\nSpecifically, we\u2019re going to load a quantized version of the [AWQ version of the Mistral 7B model](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-v0.1-AWQ).\\n\\nFirst, we\u2019ll download the model snapshot using the huggingface hub cli:\\n\\n```bash\\nhuggingface-cli download TheBloke/Mistral-7B-v0.1-GGUF \\\\\\n                mistral-7b-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf \\\\\\n                --local-dir /path/to/mistralfiles/ \\\\\\n                --local-dir-use-symlinks False\\n```\\n\\nAnd then we\u2019ll define our custom `pyfunc` model. Note the addition of the `load_context` method:\\n\\n```python\\nimport ctransformers\\nfrom mlflow.pyfunc import PythonModel\\n\\n\\nclass CTransformersModel(PythonModel):\\n    def __init__(self, gpu_layers):\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        Initialize with GPU layer configuration.\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        self.gpu_layers = gpu_layers\\n        self.model = None\\n\\n    def load_context(self, context):\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        Load the model from the specified artifacts directory.\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        model_file_path = context.artifacts[\\"model_file\\"]\\n\\n        # Load the model\\n        self.model = ctransformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\\n            model_path_or_repo_id=model_file_path,\\n            gpu_layers=self.gpu_layers,\\n        )\\n\\n    def predict(self, context, model_input):\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        Perform prediction using the loaded model.\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        if self.model is None:\\n            raise ValueError(\\n                \\"The model has not been loaded. \\"\\n                \\"Ensure that \'load_context\' is properly executed.\\"\\n            )\\n        return self.model(model_input)\\n```\\n\\nThere\u2019s a lot going on here, so let\u2019s break it down. Here are the key points:\\n\\n- As before, we use the `__init__` method to parameterize the model (in this case, to set the\\n  `gpu_layers` argument for the model).\\n- The purpose of the `load_context` method is to load the artifacts required for use in the\\n  `predict` method. In this case, we need to load the model and its weights.\\n- You\u2019ll notice that we reference `context.artifacts[\\"model_file\\"]`. This comes from the artifacts\\n  argument to `mlflow.pyfunc.save_model` or `mlflow.pyfunc.load_model`, as shown in the following\\n  code snippet. This is an important part of working with `pyfunc` models. The `predict` and\\n  `load_context` methods can access the artifacts defined in the artifacts argument to the\\n  `save_model` or `log_model` method via the `context.artifacts` object. `load_context` is executed\\n  when the model is loaded via `load_model`; as described earlier, this provides a way to ensure that\\n  the potentially time-consuming initialization of a model does not occur each time the model is used\\n  for prediction.\\n\\nNow we can initialize and save an instance of the model. Note the artifacts argument to the\\n`save_model` function:\\n\\n```python\\n# Create an instance of the model\\nmistral_model = CTransformersModel(gpu_layers=50)\\n\\n# Log the model using mlflow with the model file as an artifact\\nwith mlflow.start_run():\\n    model_info = mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(\\n        artifact_path=\\"mistral_model\\",\\n        python_model=mistral_model,\\n        artifacts={\\"model_file\\": model_file_path},\\n        pip_requirements=[\\n            \\"ctransformers==0.2.27\\",\\n        ],\\n    )\\n\\n# Load the saved model\\nloaded_model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(model_info.model_uri)\\n\\n# Make a prediction with the model\\nloaded_model.predict(\\"Question: What is the MLflow Pyfunc model flavor?\\")\\n```\\n\\nTo recap: correct use of the `load_context` method helps to ensure efficient handling of model\\nartifacts and prevents errors in serialization that could result from attempting to define artifacts\\nas model attributes.\\n\\n### Defining custom methods\\n\\nYou can define your own methods in the custom `pyfunc` model to handle tasks like preprocessing\\ninputs or post-processing outputs. These custom methods can then be called by the predict method.\\nKeep in mind that these custom methods, just like `__init__` and `predict`, should **not be used** for\\nloading artifacts. Loading artifacts is the exclusive role of the `load_context` method.\\n\\nFor example, we can modify the `CTransformersModel` to incorporate some prompt formatting as follows:\\n\\n```python\\nimport ctransformers\\nfrom mlflow.pyfunc import PythonModel\\n\\n\\nclass CTransformersModel(PythonModel):\\n    def __init__(self, gpu_layers):\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        Initialize with GPU layer configuration.\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        self.gpu_layers = gpu_layers\\n        self.model = None\\n\\n    def load_context(self, context):\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        Load the model from the specified artifacts directory.\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        model_file_path = context.artifacts[\\"model_file\\"]\\n\\n        # Load the model\\n        self.model = ctransformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\\n            model_path_or_repo_id=model_file_path,\\n            gpu_layers=self.gpu_layers,\\n        )\\n\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def _format_prompt(prompt):\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        Formats the user\'s prompt\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        formatted_prompt = (\\n            \\"Question: What is an MLflow Model?\\\\n\\\\n\\"\\n            \\"Answer: An MLflow Model is a directory that includes \\"\\n            \\"everything that is needed to reproduce a machine \\"\\n            \\"learning model across different environments. \\"\\n            \\"It is essentially a container holding the trained model \\"\\n            \\"files, dependencies, environment details, input examples, \\"\\n            \\"and additional metadata. The directory also includes an \\"\\n            \\"MLmodel YAML file, which describes the different \\"\\n            f\\"flavors of the model.\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: {prompt}\\\\nAnswer: \\"\\n        )\\n\\n        return formatted_prompt\\n\\n    def predict(self, context, model_input):\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        Perform prediction using the loaded model.\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        if self.model is None:\\n            raise ValueError(\\n                \\"Model was not loaded. Ensure that \'load_context\' \\"\\n                \\"is properly executed.\\"\\n            )\\n        return self.model(self._format_prompt(model_input))\\n```\\n\\nNow the `predict` method can access the private `_format_prompt` static method to apply custom formatting to the prompts.\\n\\n### Dependencies and Source Code\\n\\nThe custom `CTransformersModel` defined above uses the `ctransformers` library. There are a few\\ndifferent approaches for making sure this library (and any other source code, including from your\\nlocal device) is correctly loaded with your model. Correctly specifying dependencies is essential\\nfor ensuring that custom models work as expected across environments.\\n\\nThere are three main approaches to be aware of for specifying dependencies:\\n\\n- Define pip requirements explicitly with the `pip_requirements` argument to `save_model` or `log_model`.\\n- Add extra pip requirements to an automatically generated set of requirements with the\\n  `extra_pip_requirements` argument to `save_model` or `log_model`.\\n- Define a Conda environment with the `conda_env` argument to `save_model` or `log_model`.\\n\\nEarlier, we used the first approach to specify that the `ctransformers` library was needed:\\n\\n```python\\n# Log the model using mlflow with the model file as an artifact\\nwith mlflow.start_run():\\n    model_info = mlflow.pyfunc.save_model(\\n        artifact_path=\\"mistralmodel\\",\\n        python_model=mistral_model,\\n        artifacts={\\"model_file\\": \\"path/to/mistral/model/on/local/filesystem\\"},\\n        pip_requirements=[\\n            \\"ctransformers==0.2.27\\",\\n        ],\\n    )\\n```\\n\\nIf you do not specify dependencies explicitly, MLflow will attempt to infer the correct set of\\nrequirements and environment details. To enable greater accuracy, it is **strongly recommended** to\\ninclude an `input_example` when saving or logging your model due to the internal execution of a\\nsample inference step that will capture any loaded library references associated with the inference\\nexecution, enabling a higher probability that the correct dependencies will be recorded.\\n\\nYou can also work with custom code on your own filesystem with the `code_path` argument.\\n`code_path` takes a list of paths to Python file dependencies and prepends them to the system\\npath before the model is loaded, so the custom pyfunc model can import from these modules.\\n\\nSee the documentation for the [log_model](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html?highlight=pyfunc#mlflow.pyfunc.log_model) and\\n[save_model](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html?highlight=pyfunc#mlflow.pyfunc.save_model)\\nfunctions for more details on the accepted formats for `pip`, `Conda`, and local code requirements.\\n\\n### Summary: Custom Pyfunc Models in MLflow\\n\\nMLflow has built-in methods for working with models from many popular machine learning frameworks,\\nsuch as [scikit-learn](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#scikit-learn-sklearn),\\n[PyTorch](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#pytorch-pytorch), and\\n[Transformers](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/transformers/index.html). You can define your own custom\\n`mlflow.pyfunc` model when you want to work with models that do not yet have built-in model\\nflavors, or when you want to implement a custom predict method for models with built-in model flavors.\\n\\nThere are several ways to customize `pyfunc` models to get the desired behavior. Minimally, you can\\nimplement a custom `predict` method. If your model requires saving or loading artifacts, you should also\\nimplement a `load_context` method. For further customization, you can use the `__init__` method for\\nsetting custom attributes and define your own custom methods for pre- and post-processing.\\nCombining these approaches gives you the ability to flexibly define custom logic for your machine\\nlearning models.\\n\\n### Further Learning\\n\\nInterested in learning more about custom `pyfunc` implementations?

Look no further than this primer on the basics of using this powerful and time-saving feature!\\n\\n# Introduction to [mlflow.autolog](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking/autolog.html)\\n\\nRobust logging practices are central to the iterative development and improvement of machine learning models. Carefully tracking metrics, parameters, and artifacts can be challenging when working with complex machine learning libraries or when experimenting with multiple different frameworks with varying APIs and selections of different objects and values to track.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nMLflow\u2019s **automatic logging functionality** offers a simple solution that is compatible with many widely-used machine learning libraries, such as [PyTorch](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pytorch.html), [Scikit-learn](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.sklearn.html#mlflow.sklearn.autolog), and [XGBoost](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.xgboost.html#mlflow.xgboost.autolog). Using `mlflow.autolog()` instructs MLflow to capture essential data without requiring the user to specify what to capture manually. It is an accessible and powerful entrypoint for MLflow\u2019s logging capabilities.\\n\\nTo enable automatic logging, simply add the following line to your machine learning scripts/notebooks, before initiating activities like model training or evaluation that may include information or artifacts you would like to log:\\n\\n```python\\nimport mlflow\\n\\n\\nmlflow.autolog()\\n```\\n\\n## Autolog features\\n\\nWhen a data science workflow includes `mlflow.autolog()`, MLflow will automatically log:\\n\\n- **Metrics**: standard training and evaluation measures such as accuracy and F1 score;\\n- **Parameters**: hyperparameters, such as learning rate and number of estimators; and\\n- **Artifacts**: important files, such as trained models.\\n\\nMLflow\u2019s automatic logging captures details tailored to the specific activities of the library being used: different libraries will result in different logged objects and data. In addition, MLflow logs key metadata such as software versions, a git commit hash, and the file name from which the run was initiated. By documenting the system\'s state during model training, MLflow aims to facilitate environment reproducibility and provide audit lineage, minimizing the possibility of inference issues that could arise from package regressions or deprecations in newer library versions.\\n\\nThe specifics of what is captured through automatic logging depend on the libraries used. Additionally, MLflow captures contextual metadata such as software versions, git commit hash, and the name of the file from which the run was launched. By logging as much detail as possible about the state of the system that trained the model, MLflow can offer environment reproducibility and audit lineage, minimizing the possibility of inference issues resulting from, for example, package regressions or deprecations.\\n\\n## Basic Usage of `mlflow.autolog`\\n\\nYou can access auto logging functionality in two different ways:\\n\\n1. Via the `mlflow.autolog()` function, which enables and configures automatic logging across all supported libraries. This provides a broad, one-size-fits-all approach when working with multiple libraries and is ideal for prototyping and exploratory analysis of a machine learning pipeline.\\n2. Via the library-specific autolog functions, such as `mlflow.sklearn.autolog()`, which enable finer-grained logging configuration for individual libraries. For example, `mlflow.pytorch.autolog()` includes the `log_every_n_epoch` and `log_every_n_step` arguments for specifying how often to log metrics.\\n\\nRegardless of which of these two approaches you use, you do not need to manually initialize an MLflow run with [start_run()](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.start_run) in order to have a run created and for your model, parameters, and metrics to be captured in MLflow.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\n```python\\nimport mlflow\\nfrom sklearn import datasets\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\\n\\n# Generate a 3-class classification problem\\nX, y = datasets.make_classification(\\n    n_samples=1000,\\n    class_sep=0.5,\\n    random_state=42,\\n    n_classes=3,\\n    n_informative=3,\\n)\\n\\n# Split the data into training and validation sets\\nX_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\\n\\n# Enable autolog\\nmlflow.autolog()  # or mlflow.sklearn.autolog()\\n\\n# Initialize the classifier with n_estimators=200 and max_depth=10\\nclf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=200, max_depth=10)\\n\\n# Fit the classifier to the data.\\n# The `fit` method is patched to perform autologging. When engaged in training, a\\n# run is created and the parameters are logged.\\n# After the fit is complete, the model artifact is logged to the run.\\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\\n\\n# Score the model on the data\\n# The current active run is retrieved during calling `score` and the loss metrics are logged\\n# to the active MLflow run.\\nclf.score(X_val, y_val)\\n\\n# Visualize the automatically logged run results to validate what we recorded\\nmlflow.last_active_run()\\n```\\n\\nThe above logs model parameters, metrics, and the model to an MLflow run. The output result of the final statement ([mlflow.last_active_run()](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.last_active_run)) in the above example, which will return data from the run on model metrics, parameters, and logged artifacts (results truncated) is as shown below:\\n\\n```text\\n<Run: data=<RunData:\\nmetrics={\'RandomForestClassifier_score_X_val\': 0.72,\\n         \'training_accuracy_score\': 0.99625,\\n         \'training_f1_score\': 0.9962547564333545,\\n         \'training_log_loss\': 0.3354604497935824,\\n         \'training_precision_score\': 0.9962921348314606,\\n         \'training_recall_score\': 0.99625,\\n         \'training_roc_auc\': 0.9998943433719795,\\n         \'training_score\': 0.99625\\n         },\\n params={\'bootstrap\': \'True\',\\n         \'ccp_alpha\': \'0.0\',\\n         \'class_weight\': \'None\',\\n         \'criterion\': \'gini\',\\n         \'max_depth\': \'10\',\\n         \'max_features\': \'sqrt\',\\n         \'max_leaf_nodes\': \'None\',\\n         [...],\\n         },\\ntags={\'estimator_class\': \'sklearn.ensemble._forest.RandomForestClassifier\',\\n      \'estimator_name\': \'RandomForestClassifier\',\\n      \'mlflow.autologging\': \'sklearn\',\\n      [...]\\n}, [...]>>\\n```\\n\\nYou can also access these in the mlflow ui by executing [mlflow ui](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#tracking-ui) on a command line terminal.\\n\\n![The MLflow Tracking UI](./autolog_in_ui.png)\\n\\nThe MLflow UI also allows you to graphically compare different metrics and parameters across multiple runs, including those generated via `mlflow.autolog`.\\n\\n![Run comparison of autologged runs in the MLflow UI](./autolog_compare_runs.png)\\n\\n## Configuration and Customization\\n\\nThe automatic logging functions take many arguments that give the user greater control over logging behavior. For example, `mlflow.autolog()` includes `log_models` and `log_datasets` arguments (both `True` by default) that specify whether models and dataset information should be saved to the MLflow run, enabling you to specify what is actually logged. To disable automatic logging of datasets while continuing to log all the usual elements, simply disable the autologging of datasets feature by setting `mlflow.autolog(log_datasets=False)` before fitting a model. You can also adjust the behavior of library-specific autolog functions: for example, the `mlflow.sklearn.autolog()` function includes a `max_tuning_runs` argument that specifies how many nested runs to capture when performing hyperparameter searches.\\n\\n`mlflow.autolog()` can be used in combination with the library-specific autolog functions to control the logging behavior for specific libraries. The library-specific autolog call will always supersede `mlflow.autolog()`, regardless of the order in which they are called. For example, combining `mlflow.autolog()` with `mlflow.sklearn.autolog(disable=True)` will result in automatic logging for all supported libraries except for `scikit-learn`.\\n\\nIt is important to consult the documentation for the specific framework(s) you are using in order to understand what is logged automatically and what configuration options are available. See the [further reading section below](#further-reading) for links.\\n\\n## Conclusion and Next Steps\\n\\nMLflow\'s autologging capabilities and library-specific automatic logging functions provide a straightforward starting point for MLflow tracking with little or no required configuration. They log key metrics, parameters, and artifacts from many popular machine learning libraries, allowing users to track their machine learning workflows without writing custom tracking code.\\n\\nThey are not, however, the right solution for all use cases. If you only need to track a handful of specific metrics, enabling automatic logging may be inefficient, resulting in much more generated data and stored artifacts than needed. Furthermore, automatic logging is not available for every possible framework and custom values one might want to track. In such cases, it might be necessary to [manually specify what to track](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking/tracking-api.html#logging-functions).\\n\\n## Further Reading\\n\\n- [MLflow Documentation on Automatic Logging](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking/autolog.html)\\n- [Python API reference for mlflow.autolog](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.autolog)\\n- Python API references for library-specific autolog functions\\n  - [PyTorch](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pytorch.html)\\n  - [Tensorflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.tensorflow.html#mlflow.tensorflow.autolog)\\n  - [Scikit-learn](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.sklearn.html#mlflow.sklearn.autolog)\\n  - [XGBoost](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.xgboost.html#mlflow.xgboost.autolog)\\n  - [PySpark](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyspark.ml.html#mlflow.pyspark.ml.autolog)\\n  - [Statsmodels](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.statsmodels.html#mlflow.statsmodels.autolog)\\n  - [LightGBM](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.lightgbm.html#mlflow.lightgbm.autolog)\\n  - [Paddle](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.paddle.html#mlflow.paddle.autolog)\\n  - [Fastai](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.fastai.html#mlflow.fastai.autolog)"},{"id":"mlflow-docs-overhaul","metadata":{"permalink":"/mlflow-website/blog/mlflow-docs-overhaul","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-31-mlflow-docs-overhaul.md","title":"MLflow Docs Overhaul","description":"The MLflow Documentation is getting an upgrade.","date":"2023-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 31, 2023","tags":[{"label":"docs","permalink":"/mlflow-website/blog/tags/docs"}],"readingTime":5.11,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"MLflow maintainers","title":"MLflow maintainers","url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow.git","imageURL":"https://github.com/mlflow-automation.png","key":"mlflow-maintainers"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"MLflow Docs Overhaul","tags":["docs"],"slug":"mlflow-docs-overhaul","authors":["mlflow-maintainers"],"thumbnail":"img/blog/docs-overhaul.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Automatic Metric, Parameter, and Artifact Logging with mlflow.autolog","permalink":"/mlflow-website/blog/mlflow-autolog"}},"content":"The MLflow Documentation is getting an upgrade.\\n\\n## Overhauling the MLflow Docs\\n\\nWe\'re thrilled to announce a comprehensive overhaul of the MLflow Docs. This initiative is not just about refreshing the look and feel but about reimagining how our users interact with our content. Our primary goal is to enhance clarity, improve navigation, and provide more in-depth resources for our community.\\n\\n## A Renewed Focus on User Experience\\n\\nThe MLflow documentation has always been an essential resource for our users. Over time, we\'ve received invaluable feedback, and we\'ve listened. The modernization effort is a direct response to the needs and preferences of our community.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nAlong with working on covering new cutting-edge features as part of this documentation overhaul, we\'re working on addressing the complexity of getting started. As the first part of a series of tutorials and guides focusing on the initial learning phase, we\'ve created a new [getting started guide](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/getting-started/logging-first-model/index.html), the first of many in a new series we\'re working on in an effort to teach the fundamentals of using MLflow. We feel that more in-depth instructional tutorials for learning the concepts and tools of MLflow will help to enhance the user experience for not only new users, but experienced users who need a refresher of how to do certain tasks.\\n\\nThere are more of these coming in the future!\\n\\n### **Easier Navigation**\\n\\nOur first order of business is to declutter and reorganize. This is going to be a process, though. With some of the monolithic pages ([Mlflow Models](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/2.7.1/models.html)), this will be more of a marathon than a sprint.\\n\\nWe\'ve introduced a [new main navigation page](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html) in an effort to help steer you to the content that you\'re looking for based on end-use domain, rather than component of MLflow. We\'re hoping that this helps to bring new feature content and useful examples to your awareness, limiting the amount of exploratory discovery needed to understand how to use these new features.\\n\\nAnother priority for us was to make major new features easier to discover. While the [release notes](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) are useful, particularly for Engineers who are maintaining integrations with, or are managing a deployment of, MLflow, they\'re not particularly user-friendly for an end-user of MLflow. We felt that a curated list of major new features would help to distill the information in our release notes, so we built the [new features](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/new-features/index.html) page. We sincerely hope it helps to reduce the amount of effort needed to know what new major features have been released.\\n\\n### **Interactive Learning with Notebooks**\\n\\nIn today\'s fast-paced tech world, interactive learning is becoming the norm. Recognizing this trend, we\'re embedding viewable notebooks directly within the docs. But we\'re not stopping there. These notebooks are downloadable, allowing you to run, modify, and experiment with them locally. It\'s a hands-on approach to learning, bridging the gap between theory and practice.\\n\\n### **In-depth Tutorials and Guides**\\n\\nWhile our previous documentation provided a solid foundation, we felt there was room for more detailed explorations. We\'re introducing comprehensive [tutorials](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/traditional-ml/creating-custom-pyfunc/index.html) and [guides](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/llm-evaluate/index.html) that delve deep into MLflow\'s features, showing how to solve actual problems. These first new tutorials and guides are just the start. We\'re going to be spending a lot of time and effort on making much more of MLflow documented in this way, helping to dramatically reduce the amount of time you have to spend figuring out how to leverage features in MLflow.\\n\\n## Diving Deeper: Expanding on Guides and Tutorials\\n\\nOur dedication to simplifying the usage of MLflow shines through in our revamped tutorials and guides. We\'re not just providing instructions; we\'re offering [deep dives](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/custom-pyfunc-for-llms/notebooks/index.html), [best practices](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/traditional-ml/hyperparameter-tuning-with-child-runs/index.html), and real-world applications. What you see in the MLflow 2.8.0 release is just the beginning. We\'re going to be heavily focusing on creating more content, showing the best way to leverage the many features and services within MLflow, all the while endeavoring to make it easier than ever to manage any ML project you\'re working on.\\n\\n- **LLMs**: With all of the [new LLM-focused features](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/llm-evaluate/notebooks/rag-evaluation.html) we\'ve been releasing in the past year, we feel the need to create easier getting started guides,\\n  [in-depth tutorials](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/llm-evaluate/notebooks/question-answering-evaluation.html), runnable examples, and more teaching-oriented step-by-step introductions to these features.\\n\\n- **Tracking and the MLflow UI**: Our expanded section on tracking will cover everything from setting up your first experiment to advanced tracking techniques. The MLflow UI, an integral part of the platform, will also get its spotlight, ensuring you can make the most of its features.\\n\\n- **Model Registry**: The model registry is where MLflow truly shines, and our new guides will ensure you can harness its full power. From organizing models to version control, we\'ll cover it all.\\n\\n- **Recipes and LLM-focused Features**: MLflow\'s versatility is one of its strengths. Our new content will explore the breadth of features available, from recipes to LLM-focused tools like the AI Gateway, LLM Evaluation, and the PromptLab UI.\\n\\n## The Transformative Power of Interactive Notebooks\\n\\nInteractive notebooks have revolutionized data science and machine learning. By integrating them into our documentation, we aim to provide a holistic learning experience. You can see code in action, understand its impact, and then experiment on their own. It\'s a dynamic way to grasp complex concepts, ensuring that you not only understand but can also apply your knowledge in your actual project code.\\n\\n## Join Us on This Journey\\n\\nThe overhaul of the MLflow documentation is a significant milestone, but it\'s just the beginning. We have a roadmap full of exciting updates, new content, and features. And for those in our community with a passion for sharing knowledge, we have a message: We\'d love to [collaborate](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)! Whether it\'s writing tutorials, sharing use-cases, or providing feedback, every contribution enriches the MLflow community.\\n\\nIn conclusion, our commitment to providing top-notch documentation is a new primary focus of the maintainer group. We believe that well-documented features, combined with interactive learning tools, can significantly enhance the experience of using any tool. We want to put in the effort and time to make sure that your journey with using MLflow is as simple and powerful as it can be.\\n\\nStay tuned for more updates, and as always, happy coding!"}]}')}}]);
