However, with an increased velocity on major feature development comes with a risk of breaking things. As the maintainers of such a widely used project, we are cognizant of the disruptive nature of regressions and we strive to avoid them as much as we can. Aside from new feature development work, our primary goal is in ensuring the stability of production systems. While we do have the aspirational goal of moving fast(er), we certainly don't want to move fast and break things. With that goal in mind, we've decided to introduce a release candidate (RC) process.
