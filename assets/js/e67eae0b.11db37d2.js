This release includes many major features and improvements:\\n\\n### Major features:\\n\\n- **LlamaIndex Flavor**\ud83e\udd99 - MLflow now offers a native integration with [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/), one of the most popular libraries for building GenAI apps centered around custom data. This integration allows you to log LlamaIndex indices within MLflow, allowing for the loading and deployment of your indexed data for inference tasks with different engine types. MLflow also provides comprehensive tracing support for LlamaIndex operations, offering unprecedented transparency into complex queries. Check out the [MLflow LlamaIndex documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/llama-index/index.html) to get started! ([#12633](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/12633]), [@michael-berk](https://github.com/michael-berk), [@B-Step62](https://github.com/B-Step62))\\n\\n- **OpenAI Tracing**\ud83d\udd0d - We\'ve enhanced our OpenAI integration with a new tracing feature that works seamlessly with MLflow OpenAI autologging. You can now enable tracing of their OpenAI API usage with a single `mlflow.openai.autolog()` call, thereby MLflow will automatically log valuable metadata such as token usage and a history of your interactions, providing deeper insights into your OpenAI-powered applications. To start exploring this new capability, please check out [the tracing documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html#automatic-tracing)! ([#12267](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/12267), [@gabrielfu](https://github.com/gabrielfu))\\n\\n- **Enhanced Model Deployment with New Validation Feature**\u2705 - To improve the reliability of model deployments, MLflow has added a new method to validate your model before deploying it to an inference endpoint. This feature helps to eliminate typical errors in input and output handling, streamlining the process of model deployment and increasing confidence in your deployed models. By catching potential issues early, you can ensure a smoother transition from development to production. ([#12710](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/12710), [@serena-ruan](https://github.com/serena-ruan))\\n\\n- **Custom Metrics Definition Recording for Evaluations**\ud83d\udcca - We\'ve strengthened the flexibility of defining custom metrics for model evaluation by automatically logging and versioning metrics definitions, including models used as judges and prompt templates. With this new capability, you can ensure reproducibility of evaluations across different runs and easily reuse evaluation setups for consistency, facilitating more meaningful comparisons between different models or versions. ([#12487](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/12487), [#12509](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/12509), [@xq-yin](https://github.com/xq-yin))\\n\\n- **Databricks SDK Integration**\ud83d\udd10 - MLflow\'s interaction with Databricks endpoints has been fully migrated to use the [Databricks SDK](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/sdk-python.html). This change brings more robust and reliable connections between MLflow and Databricks, and access to the latest Databricks features and capabilities. We mark the legacy databricks-cli support as deprecated and will remove in the future release. ([#12313](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/12313), [@WeichenXu123](https://github.com/WeichenXu123))\\n\\n- **Spark VectorUDT Support**\ud83d\udca5 - MLflow\'s [Model Signature](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model/signatures.html) framework now supports Spark Vector UDT (User Defined Type), enabling logging and deployment of models using Spark VectorUDT with robust type validation.

**MLflow Tracing**: Tracing is powerful tool designed to enhance your ability to monitor, analyze, and debug GenAI applications by allowing you to inspect the intermediate outputs generated as your application handles a request. This update comes with an automatic LangChain integration to make it as easy as possible to get started, but we\'ve also implemented high-level fluent APIs, and low-level client APIs for users who want more control over their trace instrumentation. For more information, check out the [guide in our docs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html)!\\n- **Unity Catalog Integration**: The MLflow Deployments server now has an integration with Unity Catalog, allowing you to leverage registered functions as tools for enhancing your chat application. For more information, check out [this guide](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/deployments/uc_integration.html)!\\n- **OpenAI Autologging**: Autologging support has now been added for the OpenAI model flavor. With this feature, MLflow will automatically log a model upon calling the OpenAI API. Each time a request is made, the inputs and outputs will be logged as artifacts. Check out [the guide](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/openai/guide/index.html#openai-autologging) for more information!\\n\\nOther Notable Features:\\n\\n- [Models] Support input images encoded

2.12.0","permalink":"/mlflow-website/releases/2.12.0"}},"content":"MLflow 2.12.1 includes several major features and improvements\\n\\nWith this release, we\'re pleased to introduce several major new features that are focused on enhanced GenAI support, Deep Learning workflows involving images, expanded table logging functionality, and general usability enhancements within the UI and external integrations.\\n\\n## Major New Features\\n\\n### PromptFlow\\n\\nIntroducing the new PromptFlow flavor, designed to enrich the GenAI landscape within MLflow. This feature simplifies the creation and management of dynamic prompts, enhancing user interaction with AI models and streamlining prompt engineering processes. ([#11311](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11311), [#11385](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11385) [@brynn-code](https://github.com/brynn-code))\\n\\n### Enhanced Metadata Sharing for Unity Catalog\\n\\nMLflow now supports the ability to share metadata (and not model weights) within Databricks Unity Catalog. When logging a model, this functionality enables the automatic duplication of metadata into a dedicated subdirectory, distinct from the model\u2019s actual storage location, allowing for different sharing permissions and access control limits. ([#11357](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11357), [#11720](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11720) [@WeichenXu123](https://github.com/WeichenXu123))\\n\\n### Code Paths Unification and Standardization\\n\\nWe have unified and standardized the `code_paths` parameter across all MLflow flavors to ensure a cohesive and streamlined user experience. This change promotes consistency and reduces complexity in the model deployment lifecycle. ([#11688](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11688), [@BenWilson2](https://github.com/BenWilson2))\\n\\n### ChatOpenAI and AzureChatOpenAI Support\\n\\nSupport for the ChatOpenAI and AzureChatOpenAI interfaces has been integrated into the LangChain flavor, facilitating seamless deployment of conversational AI models.

([#11644](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11644), [@B-Step62](https://github.com/B-Step62))\\n\\n### Custom Models in Sentence-Transformers\\n\\nThe sentence-transformers flavor now supports custom models, allowing for a greater flexibility in deploying tailored NLP solutions. ([#11635](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11635), [@B-Step62](https://github.com/B-Step62))\\n\\n### Native MLflow Image support in the `log_image` API\\n\\nAdded support for optimized image logging, including step-based iterative logging for images generated as part of a training run. This feature enables the ability to track your image generation, classification, segmentation, enhancement and object detection deep learning models effortlessly. ([#11243](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11243), [#11404](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11404), [@jessechancy](https://github.com/jessechancy))\\n\\n### Image Support for Log Table\\n\\nWith the addition of image support in `log_table`, MLflow enhances its capabilities in handling rich media. This functionality allows for direct logging and visualization of images within the platform, improving the interpretability and analysis of visual data. ([#11535](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11535), [@jessechancy](https://github.com/jessechancy))\\n\\n### Streaming Support for LangChain\\n\\nThe newly introduced `predict_stream` API for LangChain models supports streaming outputs, enabling real-time output for chain invocation via pyfunc. This feature is pivotal for applications requiring continuous data processing and instant feedback. ([#11490](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11490), [#11580](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11580) [@WeichenXu123](https://github.com/WeichenXu123))\\n\\n## Security Fixes\\n\\n### LFI Security Patch\\n\\nAddressed a critical Local File Read/Path Traversal vulnerability within the Model Registry, ensuring robust protection against unauthorized access and securing user data integrity.

2.10.2","permalink":"/mlflow-website/releases/2.10.2"}},"content":"MLflow 2.11.0 includes several major features and improvements\\n\\nWith the MLflow 2.11.0 release, we\'re excited to bring a series of large and impactful features that span both GenAI and Deep Learning use cases.\\n\\n### New Deep Learning Focused Improvements in the MLflow UI\\n\\nThe MLflow Tracking UI got an overhaul to better support the review and comparison of training runs for Deep Learning workloads. From grouping to large-scale metric plotting throughout\\nthe iterations of a DL model\'s training cycle, there are a large number of quality of life improvements to enhance your Deep Learning MLOps workflow.\\n\\n### Support for PEFT, unrestrictive Pipeline logging, and weight-less model logging in transformers\\n\\nSupport for the popular [PEFT](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/transformers/guide/index.html#peft-models-in-mlflow-transformers-flavor) library from HuggingFace is now available\\nin the `mlflow.transformers` flavor. In addition to PEFT support, we\'ve removed the restrictions on Pipeline types\\nthat can be logged to MLflow, as well as the ability to, when developing and testing models, log a transformers pipeline without copying foundational model weights. These\\nenhancements strive to make the transformers flavor more useful for cutting-edge GenAI models, new pipeline types, and to simplify the development process of prompt engineering, fine-tuning,\\nand to make iterative development faster and cheaper. Give the updated flavor a try today! ([#11240](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11240), [@B-Step62](https://github.com/B-Step62))\\n\\n### Autologging for TensorFlow and PyTorch now supports checkpointing of model weights\\n\\nWe\'ve added support to both [PyTorch](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pytorch.html#mlflow.pytorch.autolog) and\\n[TensorFlow](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.tensorflow.html#mlflow.tensorflow.autolog) for automatic model weights checkpointing (including resumption from a\\nprevious state) for the auto logging implementations within both flavors. This highly requested feature allows you to automatically configure long-running Deep Learning training\\nruns to keep a safe storage of your best epoch, eliminating the risk of a failure late in training from losing the state of the model optimization. ([#11197](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/11197), [#10935](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10935), [@WeichenXu123](https://github.com/WeichenXu123))\\n\\n### ChatModel interface for a unified Chat experience with pyfunc models\\n\\nWe\'ve added a new interface to Pyfunc for GenAI workloads. The new `ChatModel` interface allows for interacting with a deployed GenAI chat model as you would with any other provider.\\nThe simplified interface (no longer requiring conformance to a Pandas DataFrame input type) strives to unify the API interface experience. ([#10820](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/10820), [@daniellok-db](https://github.com/daniellok-db))\\n\\n### Keras 3 support in MLflow\\n\\nWe now support Keras 3. This large overhaul of the Keras library introduced new fundamental changes to how Keras integrates with different DL frameworks, bringing with it\\na host of new functionality and interoperability. To learn more, see the [Keras 3.0 Tutorial](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/deep-learning/keras/quickstart/quickstart_keras.html)\\nto start using the updated model flavor today!

0.4.0 is ready, released 2018-08-01. The release is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mlflow/) and docs are [updated](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html). Here are the release notes (also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v0.4.0)):\\n\\nBreaking changes:\\n\\n- [Projects] Removed the use_temp_cwd argument to mlflow.projects.run()\\n  (--new-dir flag in the mlflow run CLI). Runs of local projects now use the local project directory as their working directory. Git projects are still fetched into temporary directories ([#215](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/215), [@smurching](https://github.com/smurching))\\n- [Tracking] GCS artifact storage is now a pluggable dependency (no longer installed by default). To enable GCS support, install google-cloud-storage on both the client and tracking server via pip ([#202](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/202), [@smurching](https://github.com/smurching)).\\n- [Tracking] Clients running MLflow 0.4.0 and above require a server running MLflow 0.4.0\\n  or above, due to a fix that ensures clients no longer double-serialize JSON into strings when sending data to the server ([#200](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/200), [@aarondav](https://github.com/aarondav)). However, the MLflow 0.4.0 server remains backwards-compatible with older clients ([#216](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/216), [@aarondav](https://github.com/aarondav))\\n\\nFeatures:\\n\\n- [Examples] Add a more advanced tracking example: using MLflow with PyTorch and TensorBoard ([#203](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/203))\\n- [Models] H2O model support ([#170](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/170), [@ToonKBC](https://github.com/ToonKBC))\\n- [Projects] Support for running projects in subdirectories of Git repos ([#153](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/153), [@juntai-zheng](https://github.com/juntai-zheng))\\n- [SageMaker] Support for specifying a compute specification when deploying to SageMaker ([#185](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/185), [@dbczumar](https://github.com/dbczumar))\\n- [Server] Added --static-prefix option to serve UI from a specified prefix to MLflow UI and server ([#116](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/116), [@andrewmchen](https://github.com/andrewmchen))\\n- [Tracking] Azure blob storage support for artifacts ([#206](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/206), [@mateiz](https://github.com/mateiz))\\n- [Tracking] Add support for Databricks-backed RestStore ([#200](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/200), [@aarondav](https://github.com/aarondav))\\n- [UI] Enable productionizing frontend by adding CSRF support ([#199](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/199), [@aarondav](https://github.com/aarondav))\\n- [UI] Update metric and parameter filters to let users control column order ([#186](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/186), [@mateiz](https://github.com/mateiz))\\n\\nBug fixes:\\n\\n- Fixed incompatible file structure returned by GCSArtifactRepository ([#173](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/173), [@jakeret](https://github.com/jakeret))\\n- Fixed metric values going out of order on x axis ([#204](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/204), [@mateiz](https://github.com/mateiz))\\n- Fixed occasional hanging behavior when using the projects.run API ([#193](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/193), [@smurching](https://github.com/smurching))\\n- Miscellaneous bug and documentation fixes from [@aarondav](https://github.com/aarondav), [@andrewmchen](https://github.com/andrewmchen), [@arinto](https://github.com/arinto), [@jakeret](https://github.com/jakeret), [@mateiz](https://github.com/mateiz), [@smurching](https://github.com/smurching), [@stbof](https://github.com/stbof)\\n\\nVisit the [change log](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst#040-2018-08-01) to read about the new features."},{"id":"0.3.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/mlflow-website/releases/0.3.0","source":"@site/releases/2018-07-18-0.3.0-release.md","title":"MLflow 0.3.0","description":"We are happy to announce the availability of MLflow 0.3.0!","date":"2018-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 18, 2018","tags":[],"readingTime":1.085,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"MLflow maintainers","title":"MLflow maintainers","url":"https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow.git","imageURL":"https://github.com/mlflow-automation.png","key":"mlflow-maintainers"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"MLflow 0.3.0","slug":"0.3.0","authors":["mlflow-maintainers"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"MLflow 0.4.0","permalink":"/mlflow-website/releases/0.4.0"},"nextItem":{"title":"MLflow 0.2.1","permalink":"/mlflow-website/releases/0.2.1"}},"content":"We are happy to announce the availability of [MLflow 0.3.0](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/releases/tag/v0.3.0)!\\n\\nMLflow Release 0.3.0 is ready, released 2018-07-18.
